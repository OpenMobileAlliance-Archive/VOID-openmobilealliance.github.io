To enable operators and manufacturers to meet the challenges in advanced services, differentiation, and fast/flexible service creation, OMA defines a set of enablers in transport, session and application layers.  This document outlines the Push Architecture and related specifications, which together specify an enabler for a service to push content to mobile devices.  • Push Architectural Overview The purpose of this document is to serve as a starting point for anybody wanting to know more about the Push technology, before taking on the other specifications. • Push Access Protocol Specification This document specifies the protocol with which a Push Initiator communicates with the PPG. See section 5.3.1.1 for a brief description. • Push Proxy Gateway Service Specification This document specifies the Push Proxy Gateway functionality, and how it interacts with the Push Access Protocol and the Push Over-The-Air protocol. See section 5.3.1 for a brief description. • Push OTA Protocol Specification This document specifies the protocol with which a PPG communicates with a push-capable client. See section 5.3.2.2 for a brief description. • Push OTA Protocol – Cell Broadcast Service (CBS) Adaptation Specification This document specifies the protocol with which a PPG communicates with a Push/CBS-capable client. See section 5.3.2.2 for a brief description. • Push Client-Application Interface Specificiation This document specifies the optional interface between a Push Client and applications, via which the application can register for push services and receive push content. See section 5.3.2.3 for a brief description. • Push Message Specification This document specifies end-to-end properties of a push message. • Service Indication Specification This document specifies a content type used for notifying users they have new information waiting on a server.

To enable operators and manufacturers to meet the challenges in advanced services, differentiation, and fast/flexible service creation, WAP defines a set of protocols in transport, session and application layers. For additional information on the WAP architecture, refer to “Wireless Application Protocol Architecture Specification” [WAP].  It is not always suitable to push content that is executed or rendered (the term “executed” is used throughout this document to refer either to “executed” or “rendered”) directly upon reception to a mobile device, especially if the client is busy with other activities such as executing another service. This is due to the fact that memory and/or processing constraints found in many mobile devices are such that neither storing nor processing content in such a situation is feasible.  Another disadvantage of pushing content directly to a mobile client is that this may interfere with an executing service that is utilising the bearer used for push, which will deteriorate the end-user experience of that service.   In order to circumvent these problems, the Service Loading (SL) content type has been defined. The content type provides a means to convey a URI to a user agent in a mobile client. The client itself automatically loads the content indicated by that URI and executes it in the addressed user agent without user intervention when appropriate. Thus, the end-user will experience the service indicated by the URI as if it was pushed to the client and executed. By basically conveying only the URI of the service to the client the over-the-air message will be small. Hence, very modest requirements are placed on the bearer and on the client’s ability to receive and store an SL if it is busy with other activities. The disadvantage of this approach is that the number of over-the-air messages and round-trips needed to deliver the service will increase.   Instead of executing the service, SL provides a means to instruct the client to pre-emptively cache the content indicated by the URI so it becomes readily available to the user agent(s) in the client. It is also possible to control whether the loading of the service may be carried out in a user-intrusive manner or not.   The SL content type is an application of the Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 [XML].
