This document describes the architecture of the DM Diagnostics and Monitoring Enabler. The architecture is based on the requirements and the use cases included in [DMDIAGMON-RD], and described at high level as believed to be significant from the architectural point of view. The dependency that Diagnostics and Monitoring Enabler has upon other DM Enablers is also addressed."},{"url":"http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/DiagMon/V1_0-20110527-C/OMA-ERELD-DiagMon-V1_0-20110527-C.pdf","file":"OMA-ERELD-DiagMon-V1_0-20110527-C.pdf","status":"Candidate","version":"V1.0","date":"2011-05-27","contentMediaType":"application/pdf","description":"The scope of this document is limited to the Enabler Release Definition of DiagMon according to OMA Release process and the Enabler Release specification baseline listed in section 5."},{"url":"http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/DiagMon/V1_0-20110527-C/OMA-ERP-DiagMon-V1_0-20110527-C.zip","file":"OMA-ERP-DiagMon-V1_0-20110527-C.zip","status":"Candidate","version":"V1.0","date":"2011-05-27","contentMediaType":"application/zip"},{"url":"http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/DiagMon/V1_0-20110527-C/OMA-RD-DiagMon-V1_0-20070306-C.pdf","file":"OMA-RD-DiagMon-V1_0-20070306-C.pdf","status":"Candidate","version":"V1.0","date":"2007-03-06","contentMediaType":"application/pdf","description":"OMA has defined an enabler releases in the Device Management space.
