The scope for the OMA is to define a set of specifications to be used by service applications. The wireless market is growing very quickly and reaching new customers and services. To enable operators and manufacturers to meet the challenges in advanced services, differentiation and fast/flexible service creation, OMA defines a set of protocols in transport, session and application layers. For additional information on the Wireless Application Environment, refer to [WAESPEC].  This specification defines a profile of the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) [RFC 2560] for mobile environments.   OCSP defines a protocol used to determine the current status of a digital certificate in lieu of using standard Certificate Revocation Lists (CRL’s).  The scope of this work is to profile OCSP in such a way to ensure it can be used efficiently by limited wireless devices and to be interoperable with OCSP responders already available in the market.
