Detailed use cases are presented along with the resulting functional requirements for the mobile device supporting SVG. In addition, key conformance and interoperability considerations are presented, aimed at those implementing these SVG requirements on a mobile device. The goal of this document is to aid the mobile developer community in creating SVG content which is interoperable across different devices in the mobile space."},{"url":"http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/SVG/V1_0-20081024-C/OMA-TS-SVG_Mobile-V1_0-20081024-C.pdf","file":"OMA-TS-SVG_Mobile-V1_0-20081024-C.pdf","status":"Candidate","version":"V1.0","date":"2008-10-24","contentMediaType":"application/pdf","description":"This section is informative. Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is a W3C specification that provides an XML-based way to describe and render 2-Dimensional graphics and graphical applications. There are two mobile profiles of SVG which are targeted towards resource-constrained devices. These are SVG Mobile and SVG Tiny [SVGT]. Of these, SVG Tiny is the specification chosen by OMA to provide 2D graphical applications within the Wireless Applications Environment [WAE]."}]}}
