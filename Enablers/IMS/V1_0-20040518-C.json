The information contained in this RD is applicable for OMA working groups that are developing service enablers that might be realized using IMS capabilities, since it is targeted to implementers of such enablers. This RD contains system level requirements to ensure interoperability between OMA service enabler realizations and an underlying IP Multimedia Subsystem (as specified by 3GPP/3GPP2). The requirements on specific OMA service enablers are not affected by this RD and are handled by the individual OMA working groups as usual. The requirements provided in this RD are oriented towards the recommendations given in the “Technical report on the usage of 3GPP/3GPP2 IMS in OMA” [TR_IMSinOMA]."}]}}
