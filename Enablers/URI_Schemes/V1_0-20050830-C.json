URI Schemes are an internet-wide accepted approach to defining entities and their relationship to protocols and applications.  They provide vendors and developers an applications independent way to bind services to identified internet entities. This document provides scope and guidance to the use of a set of these schemes in the mobile environment. While there are some existing URI Schemes in use within the OMA community, this document concentrates on those schemes that are accepted by the IETF and the internet community as a whole. Existing schemes such as wtai: are not discussed."}]}}
