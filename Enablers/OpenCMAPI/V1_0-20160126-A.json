The aim of the OMA OpenCMAPI V1.0 RD is to address requirements for:  all connectivity and connection management  aspects relevant such as: o Connection/Disconnection o All relevant elements related to the connection or the device and more specifically all elements necessary and useful to be provided to any UI and user experience or to any application needing information status on the connection. o Additional services such as SMS, USSD, GNSS... when associated to connection management and relevant for the device considered o Data service especially PUSH service configuration on the device side. The intention is that this API is  OS independent  Supporting Multi-Instance (several applications/services can use it in parallel if necessary)  Applicable to different types of devices requiring access to mobile internet such as Mobile Broadband devices, Wireless routers, M2M, Smartphones, Tablets, Cloud Devices...  User Interface independent"},{"url":"http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/OpenCMAPI/V1_0-20160126-A/OMA-TS-OpenCMAPI-V1_0-20160126-A.pdf","file":"OMA-TS-OpenCMAPI-V1_0-20160126-A.pdf","status":"Approved","version":"V1.0","date":"2016-01-26","contentMediaType":"application/pdf","description":"This specification of the OpenCMAPI defines an interface, through which connection management services are made available to different applications.
