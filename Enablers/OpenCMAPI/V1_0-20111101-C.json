The OpenCMAPI Enabler architecture is designed to support the core functionalities related to connection management, in particular Cellular network connection management, Wi-Fi management, PIN/PUK management, Information Status and call backs."},{"url":"http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/OpenCMAPI/V1_0-20111101-C/OMA-ERELD-OpenCMAPI-V1_0-20111101-C.pdf","file":"OMA-ERELD-OpenCMAPI-V1_0-20111101-C.pdf","status":"Candidate","version":"V1.0","date":"2011-11-01","contentMediaType":"application/pdf","description":"The scope of this document is limited to the Enabler Release Definition of the Open Connection Manager API (OpenCMAPI) Enabler according to OMA Release process and the Enabler Release specification baseline listed in section 5."},{"url":"http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/OpenCMAPI/V1_0-20111101-C/OMA-ERP-OpenCMAPI-V1_0-20111101-C.zip","file":"OMA-ERP-OpenCMAPI-V1_0-20111101-C.zip","status":"Candidate","version":"V1.0","date":"2011-11-01","contentMediaType":"application/zip"},{"url":"http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/OpenCMAPI/V1_0-20111101-C/OMA-RD-OpenCMAPI-V1_0-20111101-C.pdf","file":"OMA-RD-OpenCMAPI-V1_0-20111101-C.pdf","status":"Candidate","version":"V1.0","date":"2011-11-01","contentMediaType":"application/pdf","description":"This document defines the requirements for the OMA Open Connection Manager API (OpenCMAPI) V1.0. The aim of the OMA OpenCMAPI V1.0 RD is to address requirements for: \u0001 all connectivity and connection management  aspects relevant such as: o Connection/Disconnection o All relevant elements related to the connection or the device and more specifically all elements necessary and useful to be provided to any UI and user experience or to any application needing information status on the connection. o Additional services such as SMS, USSD, GPS... when associated to connection management and relevant for the device considered o Data service especially PUSH service configuration on the device side.  The intention is that this API is \u0001 OS independent  \u0001 Supporting Multi-Instance (several applications/services can use it in parallel if necessary) \u0001 Applicable to different types of devices requiring access to mobile internet such as Mobile Broadband devices, Wireless routers, M2M, Smartphones, Tablets, Cloud Devices... \u0001 User Interface independent"}]}}
