The PEEM enabler evaluates, (or evaluates and executes) policies. Policies are applied to requests to, or responses from resources or, when explicitly called by a resource. The requirements in this document are intended to facilitate the development of a set of specifications for defining, exposing, managing, evaluating, and executing policies in a way that is scalable and flexible yet independent of any specific implementation scheme.  Tools to translate enabler specific local policies into the language specified by PEEM may be needed but are out of scope of the PEEM specification. Note also that this RD does not specify individual policies, but rather addresses requirements on how to express policies."}]}}
