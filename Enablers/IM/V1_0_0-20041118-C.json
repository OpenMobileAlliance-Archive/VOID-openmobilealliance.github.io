The overall goal of this requirements document is to investigate IM service in mobile from service provider, technological and end-users’ demands. This document contributes the development of an IM Solution for OMA.   The overall goals of an OMA IM Solution can be stated as:  • Low latency (i.e. as close to real time as possible for an IM message exchange ) • Optimized and efficient use of available wireless resources • Interoperability & Interworking with other standardized IM solutions • Security • Mobility • Unrestricted by content type  Although the technical realization is assumed to be based on SIP/SIMPLE technology, this Requirements Document describes requirements at a high level, in a technology agnostic way."}]}}
