Small Cells are low-power wireless access points that work in licensed and/or unlicensed spectrum, enabling Mobile Operators and Service Providers to increase their networks’ capacity and quality in a sustainable way. Moreover, Small Cells offer peculiar capabilities that can be exposed, through convenient APIs, to Application Developers, in order to enhance Apps with new functionalities. Such Small Cells’ capabilities include fine-grained indoor localization methods, Terminals’ context-awareness and their seamless integration in Digital Home environments, enablement of Application-driven QoS, resource management and call control; those capabilities are intended to be exposed to authorized Applications – the authorization mechanism requirements are also in-scope."}]}}
