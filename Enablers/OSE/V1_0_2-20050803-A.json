The primary intention of the OSE is to promote common architectural principles, across the whole of OMA, for how OMA Enablers are specified and how they interact with one another whilst ensuring architecture integrity, scalability and interoperability, all of which strive to reduce Architecture silo design and hence reduce integration and deployment complexities. This document includes the following information: •A high-level description of the OMA Service Environment including its concepts and entities; •A migration path between existing and future enabler activities within the OMA; •A description of how OMA enablers interact with one another, for example, to support the creation and delivery of widely accessible coherent end-user services."}]}}
