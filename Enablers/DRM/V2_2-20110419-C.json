Similar to the DRM v2.1, the DRM v2.2 will focus on introducing new features based on market feedback: - Management of advertisement content to support various advertisement-based content consumption models. - Key management extensions for multicast streaming protection support. - OMA DRM protection for MPEG-2 Transport Streams. - Additional extensions for Rights Expression Language (REL) (e.g. extended support for games and executables).  Requirements in this document are requirements for versions 1.0, 2.0, 2.1 and 2.2 implementations. Requirements are backward compatible, i.e. requirements applying for a given version of the DRM apply to the higher versions, unless stated otherwise. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, all requirements listed in this document will apply to all platforms (including PC)."},{"url":"http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/DRM/V2_2-20110419-C/OMA-SUP-XSD_DRM_REL-V2_2-20110419-C.xsd","file":"OMA-SUP-XSD_DRM_REL-V2_2-20110419-C.xsd","status":"Candidate","version":"V2.2","date":"2011-04-19","contentMediaType":"application/xml"},{"url":"http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/DRM/V2_2-20110419-C/OMA-SUP-XSD_DRM_RELDD-V2_2-20110419-C.xsd","file":"OMA-SUP-XSD_DRM_RELDD-V2_2-20110419-C.xsd","status":"Candidate","version":"V2.2","date":"2011-04-19","contentMediaType":"application/xml"},{"url":"http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/DRM/V2_2-20110419-C/OMA-SUP-XSD_DRM_RELODD-V2_2-20110419-C.xsd","file":"OMA-SUP-XSD_DRM_RELODD-V2_2-20110419-C.xsd","status":"Candidate","version":"V2.2","date":"2011-04-19","contentMediaType":"application/xml"},{"url":"http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/DRM/V2_2-20110419-C/OMA-SUP-XSD_DRM_ROAP-V2_2-20110419-C.xsd","file":"OMA-SUP-XSD_DRM_ROAP-V2_2-20110419-C.xsd","status":"Candidate","version":"V2.2","date":"2011-04-19","contentMediaType":"application/xml"},{"url":"http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/DRM/V2_2-20110419-C/OMA-TS-DRM_DCF-V2_2-20110419-C.pdf","file":"OMA-TS-DRM_DCF-V2_2-20110419-C.pdf","status":"Candidate","version":"V2.2","date":"2011-04-19","contentMediaType":"application/pdf","description":"Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) specifications are the result of continuous work to define industry-wide interoperable mechanisms for developing applications and services that are deployed over wireless communication networks.
