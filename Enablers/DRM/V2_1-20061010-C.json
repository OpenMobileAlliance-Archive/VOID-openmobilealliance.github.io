Whereas the aim for DRM v2.0 was to improve the level of security of OMA DRM Version 1, due to the lack of a key management infrastructure, DRM v2.1 will focus on introducing new features based on market feedback: -A metering capability -Improvements of (P)DCF file formats linked to user experience (additional Metadata boxes) -A possibility to identify a device from servers other than those of Rights Issuers -A binary format for ROAP triggers -A capability to distinguish between different content categories (ring-tones vs music tracks, ...), & a clarified support for CD burning The 2.1 version will also clarify or correct some inconsistencies of the 2.0 version. Requirements in this document are requirements for Versions 1.0, 2.0 & 2.1 implementations. Requirements are backward compatible, i.e. requirements applying for a given version of the DRM apply to the higher versions, unless stated otherwise."}]}}
