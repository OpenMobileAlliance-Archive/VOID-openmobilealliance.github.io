This document defines the requirements for a further release of DRM specification within OMA that is referred to as “Version 2”. It was stated in [DLARCH], “A complete DRM technology is, however, not in scope of WAP Download”.  This statement reflects the comparably low level of security of OMA DRM Version 1 due to the lack of a key management infrastructure. Version 2 does not claim to be “complete”.  However, Version 2 will provide the security that was left out of Version 1 and will also address additional user requirements. Both Version 1 and Version 2 requirements in this document are requirements on Version 2 implementations. Requirements on mobile Devices that support the processing of DRM Content are defined. Requirements on servers that MAY distribute DRM Content to mobile Devices are stated with respect to their correct functioning when communicating with mobile Devices supporting DRM only."}]}}
