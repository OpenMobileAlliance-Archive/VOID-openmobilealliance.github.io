The MMS conformance document defines the minimum set of requirements and guidelines for end-to-end interoperability of MMS handsets and servers. It further serves as a baseline for MMS interoperability testing. The test environment and the test cases that need to be created for MMS interoperability testing will be based on the definition from this document. Thus the scope of this document is to serve as the basis for MMS end-to-end interoperability testing. Another significant intent of this document is to be used as a basis for discussions between vendors, operators and value added service providers to explore any such requirements that might not be clearly defined in the specifications of 3GPP, 3GPP2 or OMA with respect to interoperability."},{"url":"http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/MMS/V1_3-20050927-C/OMA-TS-MMS-CTR-V1_3-20050927-C.pdf","file":"OMA-TS-MMS-CTR-V1_3-20050927-C.pdf","status":"Candidate","version":"V1.3","date":"2005-09-27","contentMediaType":"application/pdf","description":"The Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) is a result of continuous work to define an industry-wide specification for developing applications that operate over wireless communication networks. The scope for the WAP Forum is to define a set of specifications to be used by service applications. The wireless market is growing very quickly, and reaching new customers and services. To enable operators and manufacturers to meet the challenges in advanced services, differentiation and fast/flexible service creation WAP Forum defines a set of protocols in transport, security, transaction, session and application layers. For additional information on the WAP architecture, please refer to “Wireless Application Protocol Architecture Specification” [WAPARCH]. Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) is a system application by which a WAP client is able to provide a messaging operation with a variety of media types. The service is described in terms of actions taken by the WAP MMS Client and its service partner, the MMS Proxy-Relay, a device that operates as a WAP Origin Server for this specialised service. This specification defines the operational flow of the MMS Protocol Data Units (PDUs) that transit between the MMS Client and the MMS Proxy-Relay.  The format of the specific PDUs is described in the “OMA MMS Encapsulation Protocol”[MMSENCAPS]. This document is part of the OMA MMS version 1.3 specification suite and complies with the requirements and service behaviours described in the technical specifications of the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and the 3rd Generation partnership Project 2 (3GPP2). These include the service aspects of MMS and the functional description of MMS which are contained in [TS23140] for 3GPP and [XS0016200] for 3GPP2. For information about the MMS Architecture, the reader is advised to become familiar with the “OMA MMS Architecture Overview” [MMSARCH]."},{"url":"http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/MMS/V1_3-20050927-C/OMA-TS-MMS-ENC-V1_3-20050927-C.pdf","file":"OMA-TS-MMS-ENC-V1_3-20050927-C.pdf","status":"Candidate","version":"V1.3","date":"2005-09-27","contentMediaType":"application/pdf","description":"The Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) is a result of continuous work to define an industry-wide specification for developing applications that operate over wireless communication networks.
