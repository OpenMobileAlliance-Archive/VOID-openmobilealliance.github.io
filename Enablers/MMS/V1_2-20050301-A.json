Introduction    This document outlines the Enabler Release Definition for OMA Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) and the respective conformance requirements for clients and servers implementing claiming compliance to it as defined by Open Mobile Alliance across the specification baseline. A key feature of MMS is the ability to support messaging activities with other available messaging systems.  This is shown in Figure 1 below which shows an abstract view of an MMS network diagram.  It is expected that specific MMS networks may have one or more such connections as well as include specific messaging services not directly represented (e.g. fax or voice mail systems).  InternetLegacy Wireless Messaging systems MMSSMMSMMMSRELOther MMS Systems MMS Server MMS Proxy Relay Email Server MMSMMMSSMMS Client  Figure 1 MMS Network Representation  Note that although Figure 1 identifies various interfaces, in some cases, their definition will be for further study.  The mention of these interfaces in this document does not imply that the OMA will develop the specifications necessary to describe them in detail. The system elements shown in Figure 1 can be summarised as follows: •MMS Client – This is the system element that interacts with the user.  It is expected to be implemented as an application on the user’s wireless device. •MMS Proxy-Relay – This is the system element that the MMS Client interacts with.  It provides access to the components that provide message storage services, and it is responsible for messaging activities with other available messaging systems.  Some implementations may combine this component with the MMS Server. •MMS Server – This system element provides storage services for MM messages.  Some implementations may combine this component with the MMS Proxy-Relay. •Email Server – This system element provides traditional Internet email services.  It supports the SMTP protocol to send messages as well as POP and/or IMAP protocols to retrieve messages. •Legacy Wireless Messaging Systems – This system element represents various systems that currently exist in support of wireless messaging systems.  This would include paging and SMS systems that provide messaging to a large number of subscribers. The interfaces shown in the diagram are described as follows: •MMSm– the interface defined between the MMS Client and the MMS Proxy-Relay. •MMSS- the interface defined between the MMS Server and the MMS Proxy-Relay.  This interface may be transcendental when the MMS Server and MMS Proxy-Relay are combined into a single component. •MMSR- the interface defined between MMS Proxy-Relays of separate MMS Systems.  •E- the standard email interface used between the MMS Proxy-Relay and internet-based email systems utilising SMTP, POP and IMAP transport protocols.  •L- the interfaces used between the MMS Proxy-Relay and legacy wireless messaging systems.  As there are various such systems, this is viewed as being a set of interfaces. 4.1     Example Use Case The following example information flow for a use case is provided to further illustrate the functions and roles of the various system elements in the MMS framework.  The example given here concerns end-to-end MMS messaging between terminals. 1. User activates MMS Client (assumed to be available on terminal). 2. User selects or enters MM target address(es). 3. User composes/edits MM to be sent. 4. User requests that MM is sent. 5. MMS Client submits the message to its associated MMS Proxy-Relay via the MMSMinterface. 6. MMS Proxy-Relay resolves the MM target address(es). 7. MMS Proxy-Relay routes forward the MM to each target MMS Proxy-Relay via the MMSRinterface. 8. The MM is stored by the MMS Server associated with the target MMS Proxy-Relay. 9. Target MMS Proxy-Relay sends a notification to target MMS Client via the MMSMinterface. 10. Target MMS Client retrieves the MM from the MMS Server. 11. Target MMS Client notifies target user of new MM available. 12. Target user requests rendering of received MM. 13. Target MMS Client renders MM on target user’s terminal. Note that steps 1-3 and 12-13 concern the User Interface on the terminal which is considered implementation dependent and therefore outside the scope of this specification.  Also note that steps 10 and 11 could occur in reverse order depending on MMS Client implementation, that is, an MM retrieval policy could cause the MMS Client to retrieve an MM only when so allowed by the user. 5.  Enabler Release Specification Baseline The following specifications comprise the OMA MMS enabler release: “MMS Architecture Overview Version 1.2”  [MMSARCH] “MMS Client Transactions Version 1.2” [MMSCTR] “MMS Encapsulation Protocol Version 1.2” [MMSENC] “MMS Conformance Document Version 1.2” [MMSCONF] “MMS Conformance Requirement Version 1.2 “w4 application characteristic for OMA MMS Version 1.2” [MMSCONFRD] [MMSW4]  6.  Minimum Functionality Description 6.1     Minimum Functionality of Messaging Transactions This section is informative. MMS Architecture Overview specification is the informative document and thus doesn’t contain the functionality requirement. The minimum functionality for a device implementing OMA MMS is to support the following client-server transactions specified in the MMS Client Transactions specification. (1) MMS Client Sending Message to MMS Proxy-Relay (2) MMS Proxy-Relay Sending Notification to MMS Client (3) MMS Client Retrieving Message from MMS Proxy-Relay (4) MMS Proxy-Relay Sending Delivery Report to MMS Client Note that a client device can implement either of message sending transactions that are (1) & (4), or message receiving transactions that are (2) and (3), or both of sending and receiving.  In addition, MMS Encapsulation specification provides the corresponding PDUs used in the transactions and thus a device implementing OMA MMS also needs to support the mandatory features in each of the corresponding PDU listed below. Correspondence between the transaction and PDU is provided by the SCR table (Appendix A) of [MMSCTR]. •PDU for “Send message to MMS Proxy-Relay” (M-Send.req, M-Send.conf) •PDU for “Retrieve message from MMS Proxy-Relay” (WSP/HTTP GET.req, M-Retrieve.conf) •PDU for “MMS Notification about new message” (M-Notification.ind, M-NotifyResp.ind) •PDU for “Delivery Report about sent message” (M-Delivery.ind) •PDU for “Acknowledgement of message delivery” (M-Acknowledge.ind) Since MMS is an application-level protocol framework to enable messaging transactions, a device implementing OMA MMS must have either of WAP WSP stack or HTTP/TCP/IP stack, with WAP PUSH functionality to support Notification transaction and Delivery Report transaction, in order to convey PDUs above. More detail of transport binding and the dependencies are provided in the chapter 9 and 10 respectively in [MMSCTR] 6.2     Minimum set of media type requirements This section is informative. A device implementing OMA MMS must support text/plain MIME type according to [MMSENC]. This enables a basic messaging service. If a device supports more media types than text/plain, it must conform a minimum set of the requirements related to the content of the message, the message presentation, media object formats as defined in [MMSCONF]. That document also specifies the minimum requirement for lower protocol capability such as WTP SAR, in order to guarantee the delivery of the message content. See [MMSENC] for more detail.  7.  Conformance Requirements Notation Details This section is informative   The tables in following chapters use the following notation:  Item: Entry in this column MUST be a valid ScrItem according to [CREQ].  Feature/Application: Entry in this column SHOULD be a short descriptive label to the Item in question.  Status: Entry in this column MUST accurately reflect the architectural status of the Item in question. •Mmeans the Item is mandatory for the class •O means the Item is optional for the class •NA means the Item is not applicable for the class  Requirement: Expression in the column MUST be a valid TerminalExpression according to [CREQ] and it MUST accurately reflect the architectural requirement of the Item in question. 8.
