The OMA-SEC Smart Card Technology sub-working group (SEC-SCT) has identified these requirements and proposes a solution with the Smart Card Web Server (SCWS). The SCWS enables smart card issuers to offer static or dynamic web pages. One network operator centric example could be pages generated by applications running in the smart card (e.g. SIM, UICC or R-UIM), enabling access to content (e.g. questionnaires, FAQs) or security-oriented services requiring keys that are stored in the smart card.  All these services will be accessible via a web browser in the device. This document is a requirement document for the work item presented in [SCWS WID]."}]}}
