Several standardization bodies develop smart card toolkit standards in order to fulfill these requirements. The Smart Card Web Server (SCWS) intends to enable smart card issuers (e.g. Mobile Network Operators) to offer static or dynamic web pages. One operator centric example could be pages generated by applications running in the smart card (e.g. SIM, UICC  or  R-UIM),  enabling local access  to content (e.g. questionnaires, FAQs) or security-oriented services requiring keys stored in the smart card.  All these services will be accessible via a Web browser. This document is an architecture document for the SCWS Enabler (work item presented in [SCWS WID]). It depicts the functionality, interfaces and information flow that is needed to address the requirements related to this work item as described in the Smartcard Web Server Requirements document [SCWS-RD]. This work item addresses the interfaces needed to access and use a web server in the smart card, the HTTP profile that need to be implemented and the access control to this SCWS. The web server implementation in the smart card is considered out of the scope for this release so this document does not describe the SCWS internal entities within such an implementation."},{"url":"http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/SCWS/V1_1_1-20100910-A/OMA-ERELD-Smartcard_Web_Server-V1_1_1-20100910-A.pdf","file":"OMA-ERELD-Smartcard_Web_Server-V1_1_1-20100910-A.pdf","status":"Approved","version":"V1.1.1","date":"2010-09-10","contentMediaType":"application/pdf","description":"The scope of this document is limited to the Enabler Release Definition of Smartcard Web Server (SCWS) v1.1 according to OMA Release process and the Enabler Release specification baseline listed in section 5."},{"url":"http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/SCWS/V1_1_1-20100910-A/OMA-ERP-Smartcard_Web_Server-V1_1_1-20100910-A.zip","file":"OMA-ERP-Smartcard_Web_Server-V1_1_1-20100910-A.zip","status":"Approved","version":"V1.1.1","date":"2010-09-10","contentMediaType":"application/zip"},{"url":"http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/SCWS/V1_1_1-20100910-A/OMA-RD-Smartcard_Web_Server-V1_0-20080421-A.pdf","file":"OMA-RD-Smartcard_Web_Server-V1_0-20080421-A.pdf","status":"Approved","version":"V1.0","date":"2008-04-21","contentMediaType":"application/pdf","description":"Network operators aim to improve the user experience when using network operator services in the smart card.
