The  Dynamic  Content  Delivery  (DCD)  Enabler  is  expected  to  enhance  a  mobile  userâ€™s  experience  through  the  periodic  delivery of personalised or customized content to a device. Such content may be based on the subscription and preferences of the user, operator or service provider. As a complementary delivery mechanism to the existing mechanisms, e.g. browsing, messaging, etc., it will reuse as much existing technology as possible, while providing the added benefits of delivery control management, and an enhanced user experience. The  content  delivery  should  support  various  network  technologies  (i.e.  network  types  and/or  bearers),  and  may  operate  autonomously  in  the  background.    The  content  types  and  formats  used  by  DCD  will,  wherever  possible,  be  consistent  with  those of the established mechanisms. The DCD Enabler enables an application and its delivery to be enhanced by making it available asynchronously and through automatic means though it does not specify detailed DCD applications, or how to render those applications."}]}}
