The aim of the OMA DANE V1.0 RD is to define requirements for supporting the following:  Definition of a set of Device APIs to be exposed to Device Apps by a Device Service Optimizer; through those APIs authorized Apps will register to the DSO declaring their needs in terms of QoS, tolerance to delay etc.;  Definition of mapping rules (applied by the Device Service Optimizer) between Apps requesting a particular QoS, the related IP flows and network interfaces on Device. OMA DANE V1.0 RD includes also requirements for future releases of DANE Enabler:  Definition of a solution identifying all Apps present on the device and their impacts on the network in terms of signalisation and shaping the signalling traffic they generate based on categorisation."}]}}
