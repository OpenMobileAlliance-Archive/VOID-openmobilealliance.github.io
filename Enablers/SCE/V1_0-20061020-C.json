These enhancements include the following: •New capabilities that will enable flexible sharing of purchased content in ways that were not possible using Domains as  defined  in  OMA  DRM  V2.0.    These  new  features  include  device-based  creation  and  management  of  content  sharing groups; copying and moving of rights between OMA DRM devices; and sharing between devices in ad hoc groups. •The  definition  of  an  Import  function  that  will  allow  content  protected  by  non-OMA  DRM  mechanisms  to  be  consumed  by  OMA  DRM  devices.    Together  with  the  Export  function  defined  in  OMA  DRM  V2.0,  the  Import  function will make it possible for OMA DRM devices to securely exchange content with non-OMA DRM devices."}]}}
