This document provides the architecture for the GSSM enabler. The role of the GSSM enabler is to specify how authorized principals are accessing and/or managing the service subscription (e.g. subscribing to a service, unsubscribing from a service, change of subscription (parameters), subscription suspension/resumption/renewal) and accessing subscription profile, and to specify how subscription validation requests are defined and processed. The scope of the GSSM architecture document is to define the architecture for the GSSM enabler based on the requirements as described in the GSSM Requirements Document [GSSM-RD]. The scope of this Architecture Document does not include the interface between GSSM enabler and other enabler/resources (such as BSS/OSS). GSSM interfaces can be re-used to also expose additional subscription related information (e.g. about the subscriber)."},{"url":"http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/GSSM/V1_0-20091022-C/OMA-ERELD-GSSM-V1_0-20091022-C.pdf","file":"OMA-ERELD-GSSM-V1_0-20091022-C.pdf","status":"Candidate","version":"V1.0","date":"2009-10-22","contentMediaType":"application/pdf","description":"The scope of this document is limited to the Enabler Release Definition of GSSM (General Service Subscription Management) according to OMA Release process and the Enabler Release specification baseline listed in section 5."},{"url":"http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/GSSM/V1_0-20091022-C/OMA-ERP-GSSM-V1_0-20091022-C.zip","file":"OMA-ERP-GSSM-V1_0-20091022-C.zip","status":"Candidate","version":"V1.0","date":"2009-10-22","contentMediaType":"application/zip"},{"url":"http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/GSSM/V1_0-20091022-C/OMA-RD-GSSM-V1_0-20091022-C.pdf","file":"OMA-RD-GSSM-V1_0-20091022-C.pdf","status":"Candidate","version":"V1.0","date":"2009-10-22","contentMediaType":"application/pdf","description":"The  scope  of  this  document  is  to  collect  use  cases  and  requirements  for  service  subscription  management  for  value  added  services.
