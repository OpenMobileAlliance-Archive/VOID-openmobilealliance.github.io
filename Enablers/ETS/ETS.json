Introduction  The purpose of this document is to provide client conformance test cases for \"Mobile Broadcast Services version 1.0\". BCAST is a complex enabler which requires tests for conformance and interoperability in a client/server scenario with different access networks. Some features in the BCAST enabler may optionally be implemented in mobile devices.  The tests associated with these optional features are marked as [Optional] in the test specification. Terminals that support ESG delivery using both Broadcast and Interaction Channel are required to run all applicable test cases using both ESG delivery methods.

The terminal receives continuous STKMs stream for the service with the Key domain ID= MCC1|| MNC1.  TEK ID of STKM is incremented for each TEK renewal with a cryptoperiod of 10s. Within a crypto period TEK ID is not changed (STKM sent every second; i.e 10 times within the crypto period) but TS changes for each STKM within the crypto period. TS starts with 0x00 00 00 01 and TEK_ID with 0x00 01.
