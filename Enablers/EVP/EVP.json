While the specific test activities to be performed are described in the Enabler Test Specification (ETS) the test environment is described in this plan.  This test environment details infrastructure, operational and participation requirements identified for the needed testing activities. The list of specifications, defining the scope of XDM V2.0, as stated in [ERELD_XDMv2] is according the following: -XDM V2.0 Requirements [XDMv2_RD] -XDM V2.0 Architecture [XDMv2_AD] -XDM V2.0 Specification [XDMv2_Core] -XDM V2.0 Management Object [XDMv2_MO] -XDM V1.0 Shared Group [XDMv1_ Group] -XDM V2.0 Shared List [XDMv2_ List] -XDM V1.0 Shared Policy [XDMv1_ Policy] -XDM V1.0 Shared Profile [XDMv1_ Profile] In  addition  to  the  mentioned  specifications  comprising  the  XDM  V2.0  enabler,  a  data  dictionary  (DTD)  is  defined  in  [ERELD_XDMv2], Section 5 (Supporting Files). Interoperability of XDM Enabler is tested based on the latest available XDM INT ETS, and also on XDM V1.0 INT ETS documents. Note that since the OMA XDM test tool is not available at this time, the document specifies the interoperability aspects only. 1.1     Assumptions     The XDM enabler will always be tested with other Enablers, e.g., with PoC, or SIMPLE IM. It is also assumed that XDM V2.0 implementations are backwards compatible in the sense they implement XDM V1.0 mandatory requirements. 1.2     Exclusions     Since XDM test tool is not currently available, it should be noted that it is expected that OMA Trusted Zone will determine participating teams’ readiness by evaluating pre-testing results. Pre-testing is performed during the first day of the TestFest event. Test cases to be performed during pre-testing, as well as logistical guidance for Trusted Zone are presented in Section 5.3.1."},{"url":"http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/EVP/README.txt","file":"README.txt","status":"","version":"","date":"","contentMediaType":"text/plain"}]}}
