The requirements in this document  addresses how OMA OSE and Parlay/OSA architectures could be integrated and components implementation/ realizations coexist.  This PIOSE RD describes requirements on integration of OSA/Parlay, Parlay X Web Service and OSE. The information contained in this RD is applicable to OMA working groups that are developing service enablers that may use other resources such as Parlay, Parlay X components. The RD  focuses on determining the requirements for how the OSE could take advantage of Parlay/OSA components. The requirements on specific OMA service enablers are not affected by this RD and are handled by the individual OMA working groups as usual. Parlay/OSA architecture[OSA] is not affected by this RD either."}]}}
