Therefore, the requirements contained in this document are limited to these aspects (i.e., the storage, management and re-use of such documents containing information by other applications).   The privacy of personal data, such as, principal identity is protected according to privacy regulations.  However, mechanisms to obtain the permission of principal (e.g., before they are included in lists that are managed by the XDM enabler) are out of scope. The XDM enabler provides mechanisms for principals to specify who can access the data they have stored.  In addition, the owner of a XDM enabler deployment has full access to this data (overriding any principal preferences) for purposes, such as, administration and maintenance.  The application of those administrative rights in relation to principal preferences may be described in legal or contractual policies, and as such is out of scope for this enabler. The XDM enabler is designed to support other OMA service enablers and applications.  It is envisioned that there will be multiple enabler specifications to satisfy the requirements in this document."},{"url":"http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/XDM/V1_0_1-20061128-A/OMA-SUP-XSD_xdm_CommonPolicy-V1_0_1-20061128-A.txt","file":"OMA-SUP-XSD_xdm_CommonPolicy-V1_0_1-20061128-A.txt","status":"Approved","version":"V1.0.1","date":"2006-11-28","contentMediaType":"text/plain"},{"url":"http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/XDM/V1_0_1-20061128-A/OMA-SUP-XSD_xdm_rsrclst_appusage-V1_0-20060612-A.txt","file":"OMA-SUP-XSD_xdm_rsrclst_appusage-V1_0-20060612-A.txt","status":"Approved","version":"V1.0","date":"2006-06-12","contentMediaType":"text/plain"},{"url":"http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/XDM/V1_0_1-20061128-A/OMA-SUP-XSD_xdm_rsrclst_uriusage-V1_0-20060612-A.txt","file":"OMA-SUP-XSD_xdm_rsrclst_uriusage-V1_0-20060612-A.txt","status":"Approved","version":"V1.0","date":"2006-06-12","contentMediaType":"text/plain"},{"url":"http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/XDM/V1_0_1-20061128-A/OMA-SUP-XSD_xdm_xcapDirectory-V1_0_1-20061128-A.txt","file":"OMA-SUP-XSD_xdm_xcapDirectory-V1_0_1-20061128-A.txt","status":"Approved","version":"V1.0.1","date":"2006-11-28","contentMediaType":"text/plain"},{"url":"http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/XDM/V1_0_1-20061128-A/OMA-SUP-XSD_xdm_xcapError-V1_0-20060612-A.txt","file":"OMA-SUP-XSD_xdm_xcapError-V1_0-20060612-A.txt","status":"Approved","version":"V1.0","date":"2006-06-12","contentMediaType":"text/plain"},{"url":"http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/XDM/V1_0_1-20061128-A/OMA-TS-XDM_Core-V1_0_1-20061128-A.pdf","file":"OMA-TS-XDM_Core-V1_0_1-20061128-A.pdf","status":"Approved","version":"V1.0.1","date":"2006-11-28","contentMediaType":"application/pdf","description":"This document specifies common protocols, data access conventions, common data application usages and two entities that are needed to provide XDM services to other enablers.
