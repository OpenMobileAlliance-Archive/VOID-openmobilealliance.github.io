It mainly focuses on requirements to enable a DM Server to manage devices that are not directly accessible to the OMA-DM Server e.g. because the devices are deployed behind a firewall or because the devices do not support the OMA-DM protocol.  This document also provides requirements for management of devices in a Machine to Machine (M2M) ecosystem (e.g. fanning out DM commands from a DM Server to multiple end devices and aggregating responses from multiple end devices so that a consolidated response is sent back to the DM Server).   The following issues are outside the scope of this document: \u0001 Device discovery mechanisms \u0001 Management protocol adaptation rules"}]}}
