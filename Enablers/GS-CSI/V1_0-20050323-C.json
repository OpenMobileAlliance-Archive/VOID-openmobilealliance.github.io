The Requirements herein should be understood as those minimally necessary to implement a service that supports connect and multiplayer gaming over mobile networks and devices; a more comprehensive Game Service RD is planned.  The document notes when Requirements overlap with, or can be satisfied by, other OMA working groups or other standards external to OMA.  The Requirements fall in to five distinct phases of the Userâ€™s interaction with the Game Service: obtaining the game over the the air from the Game Service; activating the game in connected, or multiplayer, mode and subsequent accounting, access, authentication and authorization; creating a new, or enterring an existing game session; game play and User experience despite network lapses; and finally statistics, usage capture, and personalization.  It should be noted that portions of these five phases may be implemented by different business entities."}]}}
