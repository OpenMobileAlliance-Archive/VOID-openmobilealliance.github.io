The Client Profile of OMA Device Management specifies a subset of the existing OMA Device Management v1.3 specifications. This profile document contains tables with information on what features are mandated in the profile that MUST be implemented in order for a Device Client to claim conformance with the profile.  This specification is addressing deployment and operational considerations for constraint devices, and is re-using a subset of the OMA Device Management v1.3 functionality for this. It aims to reduce the effort and time needed to create Device Clients that could be used with existing OMA Device Management servers in all kind of environments including M2M."}]}}
