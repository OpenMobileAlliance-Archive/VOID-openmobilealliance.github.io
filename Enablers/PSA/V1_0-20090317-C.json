The aim of this OMA PSA RD is to address (per OMA processes) those requirements in [3GPP TS 22.127] for which no technical work has been done in 3GPP and for which the responsibility of defining the resulting solution specification has been moved to OMA ARC WG. For this reason, no new requirements with respect to those frozen 3GPP Release 8 Stage 1 ones will be considered as part of this OMA PSA APIs v.1.0. Applications/enablers which make use of network functionality offered through the PSA interface are out of scope of this document."}]}}
