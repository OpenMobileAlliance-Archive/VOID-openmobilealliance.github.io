This document specifies the Web Service technologies that will be used to publish, discover and use these components in a secure, controlled and auditable manner. The OMA Web Services Enabler (OWSER) defines the means by which OMA applications can be exposed, discovered and consumed using Web Services technologies.  The purpose of the OWSER is to provide designers of Web Services within OMA with solutions to common functions using Web Services technologies.  Without such a framework, designers of Web Services within OMA would almost certainly try to solve these problems on their own, each in their own way.  Such an effort would inevitably lead to brittle implementations, interoperability problems, and increased time to market. These goals are consistent with those expressed in the OMA Service Enabler Strategy White Paper [OMASES].  The OMA Web Services Enabler (OWSER): Overview document [OWSEROvw] provides the rationale for using Web Services and an overview of the technologies to implement a set of identified common functions that are expected to be available to all OMA applications. The OMA Web Services Enabler (OWSER): Network Identity Specifications [OWSERNI] document specifies the components needed to support aspects of network identity related capabilities of the OWSER. The OMA Web Services Enabler (OWSER) Best Practices: WSDL Style Guide [OWSERBP] provides non-normative information on the use of WSDL that may be used by OMA-defined Web Services. This document provides the specifications of the components needed to provide the capabilities of the OWSER as identified in [OWSEROvw], in particular the normative use of Web Service technologies to implement such capabilities.  Ths document is intended to provide normative guidance to designers of specific OMA Web Services and implementers thereof. Therefore, material of a tutorial nature is kept to a minimum.  Not all components of the OWSER are specified in this version (1.0) of the document. This version specifies technologies that will enable applications acting in the role of Web Service Requesters (WSR) to access services offered by Web Service providers (WSP). No restriction is placed on the types of computing devices – mobile terminals, personal computers, servers etc. – that can be WSRs or WSPs, so long as they are capable of supporting the technologies specified in this document. Future versions of this specification will provide additional functionality to complete the full range of capabilities offered by the OWSER."},{"url":"http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/OWSER/OMA-OWSER-Network_Identity-Specification-V1_0-20040316-C.pdf","file":"OMA-OWSER-Network_Identity-Specification-V1_0-20040316-C.pdf","status":"Candidate","version":"V1.0","date":"2004-03-16","contentMediaType":"application/pdf","description":"This document is part of a series of documents [OWSERSpec] [OWSEROvw] that will be used to specify components of the OMA Web Services Enabler (OWSER).
