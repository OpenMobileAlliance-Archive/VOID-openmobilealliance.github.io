The architecture is based on the requirements and the use cases included in SCIDM Requirements document [SCIDM-RD] and described at high level as believed to be significant from the architectural point of view. The objective of the SCIDM Enabler is to leverage available identification mechanisms to identify all kinds of content including both premier and user generated content for various applications. Among the available identification mechanisms, Content Fingerprint based identification is mandatory to be supported in this Enabler. The architecture shown in this document is intended to facilitate the development of specifications for content registration, query and identification. The description of the architecture comprises the definition of functional components and the interfaces used or exposed by these functional components. Note that this Enabler does not specify application-specified mechanisms, such as the content management schemes and rules. Definition of metadata for specific applications is also out of scope."},{"url":"http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/SCIDM/V1_0-20120403-A/OMA-ERELD-SCIDM-V1_0-20120403-A.pdf","file":"OMA-ERELD-SCIDM-V1_0-20120403-A.pdf","status":"Approved","version":"V1.0","date":"2012-04-03","contentMediaType":"application/pdf","description":"The scope of this document is limited to the Enabler Release Definition of SCIDM according to OMA Release process and the Enabler Release specification baseline listed in section 5."},{"url":"http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/SCIDM/V1_0-20120403-A/OMA-ERP-SCIDM-V1_0-20120403-A.zip","file":"OMA-ERP-SCIDM-V1_0-20120403-A.zip","status":"Approved","version":"V1.0","date":"2012-04-03","contentMediaType":"application/zip"},{"url":"http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/SCIDM/V1_0-20120403-A/OMA-RD-SCIDM-V1_0-20120403-A.pdf","file":"OMA-RD-SCIDM-V1_0-20120403-A.pdf","status":"Approved","version":"V1.0","date":"2012-04-03","contentMediaType":"application/pdf","description":"This Requirement Document (RD) contains use cases and defines the requirements for the Secure Content Identification Mechanism enabler to identify all kinds of content including both premier and user generated content, for various applications such as copyright verification, software authentication, and content filtering, etc. The following areas will be covered in this RD:  Content identity registration/query/verification/certification/error reporting  Content ID assignment  Secure content identification/authentication mechanisms Secure Content Identification Mechanism enabler will reuse as much as possible existing technologies.
