The origins of this enabler lie in the Wireless Village initiative. When Wireless Village was incorporated into OMA, the version 1.1 of its specifications became the OMA IMPS 1.1 enabler. Afterwards the IMPS 1.2 enabler was finalized within OMA.   The IMPS 1.3 enabler is a significant enhancement of the IMPS 1.2 enabler and is not designed to be backwardly compatible with previous IMPS versions. The Instant Messaging and Presence Service (IMPS) includes four primary features: •Presence •Instant Messaging •Groups •Shared Content Presence is the key enabling technology for IMPS. It includes client device availability (my phone is on/off, in a call), user status (available, unavailable, in a meeting), location, client device capabilities (voice, text, GPRS, multimedia) and searchable personal statuses such as mood (happy, angry) and hobbies (football, fishing, computing, dancing). Since presence information is personal, it is only made available according to the user's wishes - access control features put the control of the user presence information in the users' hands. Instant Messaging (IM) is a familiar concept in both the mobile and desktop worlds. Desktop IM clients, two-way SMS and two-way paging are all forms of Instant Messaging. IMPS will enable interoperable mobile IM in concert with other innovative features to provide an enhanced user experience. Groups or chat are a fun and familiar concept on the Internet. Both operators and end-users are able to create and manage groups. Users can invite their friends and family to chat in group discussions. Operators can build common interest groups where end-users can meet each other online. Shared Content allows users and operators to setup their own storage area where they can post pictures, music and other multimedia content while enabling the sharing with other individuals and groups in an IM or chat session. These features, taken in part or as a whole, provide the basis for innovative new services that build upon a common interoperable framework."},{"url":"http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/IMPS/V1_3-20051011-C/OMA-ERELD-IMPS-V1_3-20051011-C.pdf","file":"OMA-ERELD-IMPS-V1_3-20051011-C.pdf","status":"Candidate","version":"V1.3","date":"2005-10-11","contentMediaType":"application/pdf","description":"The scope of this document is limited to the Enabler Release Definition of IMPS according to OMA Release process and the Enabler Release specification baseline listed in section 5 Enabler Release Specification Baseline."},{"url":"http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/IMPS/V1_3-20051011-C/OMA-ERP-IMPS-V1_3-20051011-C.zip","file":"OMA-ERP-IMPS-V1_3-20051011-C.zip","status":"Candidate","version":"V1.3","date":"2005-10-11","contentMediaType":"application/zip"},{"url":"http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/IMPS/V1_3-20051011-C/OMA-RD_IMPSDelta-V1_3-20041118-C.pdf","file":"OMA-RD_IMPSDelta-V1_3-20041118-C.pdf","status":"Candidate","version":"V1.3","date":"2004-11-18","contentMediaType":"application/pdf","description":"The OMA Instant Messaging and Presence Service (IMPS) includes four primary features: •Presence •Instant Messaging •Groups •Shared Content Presence  is  the  key  enabling  technology  for  IMPS.
