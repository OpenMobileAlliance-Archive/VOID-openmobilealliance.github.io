CSP is a session-oriented protocol, as explained in Section 5. An abstract level description of all the CSP Transactions is provided  form  Sections  6  thru  10.  The  description  starts  from  general  primitives  and  continues  through  the  feature-specific ones. The IMPS enabler consists of four primary functional features: •Presence •Instant Messaging •Groups •Shared Content The above features are described in [Arch]. Section 11 describes the Status or Error Codes that are used in response primitive of every IMPS transaction.  Appendix  B  lists  the  Static  Conformance  Requirements  for  CSP,  which  specifies  the  Minimum  Interoperability  requirements as well as the optional features that allow enhancing the IMPS service."}]}}
