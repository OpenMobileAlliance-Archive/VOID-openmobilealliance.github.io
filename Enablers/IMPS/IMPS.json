The Wireless Village Instant Messaging and Presence Service (IMPS) includes four primary features: • Presence • Instant Messaging • Groups • Shared Content Presence is the key enabling technology for IMPS. It includes client device availability (my phone is on/off, in a call), user status (available, unavailable, in a meeting), location, client device capabilities (voice, text, GPRS, multimedia) and searchable personal statuses such as mood (happy, angry) and hobbies (football, fishing, computing, dancing). Since presence information is personal, it is only made available according to the user's wishes - access control features put the control of the user presence information in the users' hands. Instant Messaging (IM) is a familiar concept in both the mobile and desktop worlds. Desktop IM clients, two-way SMS and two-way paging are all forms of Instant Messaging.

Terminology and Conventions 3.1 Conventions The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. All sections and appendixes, except “Scope” and “Introduction”, are normative, unless they are explicitly indicated to be informative. 3.2 Definitions None 3.3 Abbreviations  None 4. Introduction  This document describes the transactions and the information elements in transactions that are used to provide Wireless Village services and the interoperability of different implementations. 5. WV session 5.1 Session management The Wireless Village session is a framework in which the WV services are provided to the WV client. The WV session is transport-independent. If the transport connection is broken, the client can reconnect and continue the session. The client device may be even turned on and off and the session may still be continued. The WV session is established when the client logs in and terminated when either the client logs out or the SAP decides to disconnect the session. The session is identified by a Session-ID. In addition, the WV client provides at login phase a client-unique session cookie for the session, which is used by the server to trigger communications in some cases. The authentication of the user is done at the login phase. The authentication is, in general, considered to be valid throughout the session. However, the server may, at any time disconnect the session and request the client to re-login. In this case, the client provides the old session-ID. After valid authentication, the WV server may accept to reestablish the old session. During the WV session, both the client and SAP have to maintain session context. The session context contains dynamic information of the services the client is currently using. The WV specifications do not explicitly define what is the actual state of services the session context contains, but it assumes that the negotiated services for the session are valid throughout the session. The session context in the WV server and the WV client are tied together by the services the user is currently using (subscribed presence attributes, joined groups, authorized presence attributes, etc). The WV server and WV client may assume that the link between the contexts is valid throughout the WV session as well as reestablished session. When the session is terminated and a new session is established, the WV server may still maintain some services, such as subscribed presence attributes. This is an implementation issue in the WV server. 5.2 Addressing 5.2.1 Introduction The Wireless Village addressing model introduces an unique WV address space. The definition of the addresses is based on the URI format [RFC2396]. The addressable entities are: • User • Contact list • User group (private and public) • Content (private and public) Use of other address spaces may be used to interoperate with other systems, but their use is out of the scope of Wireless Village specifications. In addition to the user, the WV client the user is using may be addressed as well. In this specification version, the client identification is defined but its exact semantics and use cases are left for next WV specification release. 5.2.2 Generic address format The generic address syntax is based on URI [RFC2396]. The wv-schema in the URI indicates the use of wv-addressing space. The generic syntax is defined as follows: Address = \"wv:\" [User-ID] [\"/\" Resource] [\"@\" Domain] Resource = Group-ID | Contact-List-ID | Content-ID Domain = sub-domain *(“.” sub-domain)  where User-ID refers to the identification of the WV user, Domain identifies the WV server domain, and Resource further identifies the referred public or private resource within the domain. The sub-domain is defined in [RFC822]. When the User-ID is present without the Resource, the address refers to the user. When User-ID is present with Resource, the address refers to the private resource of the user. When User-ID is not present, the Resource must always be present and then the address refers to a public resource within the domain. The Domain part is optional. When it is not present, the address refers implicitly to the home domain. The addresses are case insensitive. 5.2.3  Address encoding As per URI [RFC2396], certain reserved characters must be escaped if they occur within the User-ID, Resource, or Domain portions of a Wireless Village address. This includes the characters “;”, “?”, “:”, “&”, “=”, “+”, “$” and “,”. For example, a valid Wireless Village address for the user “$mith” in the “server.com” domain is: wv:%24mith@server.com   Certain characters are not allowed in the User-ID portion of Wireless Village addresses (see 4.2.4, below). This includes the characters “/”, “@”, “+”, “ “ and TAB. This restriction is independent of the encoding of a User-ID within a Wireless Village address. For example, this Wireless Village address is not permissible: wv:john%40aol.com@server.com  This address is not permissible because after URI-decoding, the User-ID portion contains a forbidden character (“@”). If a server’s internal representation of a username permits the occurrence of forbidden characters, such characters must be double-escaped when they occur in a Wireless Village address, such that they do not occur unescaped in the User-ID portion after URI-decoding, or they must be escaped via some other scheme that does not employ forbidden characters. 5.2.4 User addressing CSP uses User-IDs to uniquely identify any WV User. The User-ID is syntactically equivalent to an e-mail address, and as such is subject to the same restrictions for character set, as described in “Standard for the Format of ARPA Internet Text Messages” [RFC822]. The User ID is either a local User ID which is the domain that the client is logged on (home-domain) or an external User ID, which is on another domain. The User-ID either refers to the Internet-type address or to a mobile number of the user. If the User-ID refers to the mobile number of the user, the user name always starts either with a digit or with a '+' sign. A user name referring to Internet-type address may not start with a '+' sign or digit. The syntax if the User-ID is defined as follows: User-ID = Mobile-Identity | Internet-Identity Internet-Identity = *alpha  Mobile-Identity = (digit | \"+\") *digit digit = \"0\" | \"1\" | \"2\" |\"3\" |\"4\" |\"5\" |\"6\" |\"7\" |\"8\" | \"9\" alpha = Any ISO 8859-1 character except specials specials = \"/\" | \"@\" | \"+\" | \" \" | TAB  When the User-ID refers to the mobile number address, the User-ID preceded with '+' sign refers to the international numbering in The International Public Telecommunication Numbering Plan [E.164]. Without '+' sign, it refers to the national numbering in the [E.164]. Examples: Local-User-ID: wv:yuriyt  wv:+1234567890  wv:4567890 External-User-ID: wv:Jon.Smith@imps.com  wv:+1234567890@imps.com  wv:4567890@imps.com The users may also be identified by screen names, nicknames and aliases. These identifiers explicitly and implicitly refer to the User-ID. ScreenName – the combination of a name a user chooses in a group session, and the Group-ID itself. The user may have different ScreenNames on different occasions as well as on different groups. The ScreenName is always connected to a group. NickName – A name that is used internally in a client to hide the UserID of contacts. When a ContactList is stored on the server the NickName must have a space. It is not possible to address a NickName. Alias – The name a user suggest others to use as NickName. Part of the User Presence. 5.2.5 Contact List Addressing The CSP uses Contact List IDs to uniquely identify any contact list of any user. The contact list ID is based on the generic address syntax. The contact list may be a public contact list ora private contact list. The syntax is defined as follows: Contact-List-ID = *alpha Examples for the contact list IDs are: wv:john/colleagues@imps.com wv:/managers wv:john/friends wv:/managers@imps.com  5.2.6 User Group The CSP uses a Group ID to uniquely identify a group. The Group-ID is based on the generic address syntax. The user group may be public user group or private user group. The syntax of the group ID is defined as follows: Group-ID = *alpha Examples of the Group-IDs are: wv:john/mygroup@imps.com ww:john/mygroup wv:/technicalforum wv:/technical_forum@imps.com  5.2.7 Content Addressing The CSP uses a Content ID to uniquely identify a group. The Content ID is based on the generic address syntax. The syntax of the Content ID is as follows: Content-ID = *alpha Examples of the Content IDs are: wv:john/WV_presentation wv:john/WV_presentation@imps.com wv:/wvspec wv:/wvspec@imps.com  5.2.8 Client Addressing The client-ID is a unique identifier of the WV client that the user is currently using. It identifies the WV client as an application and its location that accesses the WV services. The client-ID is intended to allow: • Multiple access from the same user • Direct application-to-application communication. The Client-ID consists of • An optional application identifier as a URL identifying the application and its location. • An optional mobile device identity (such as international mobile number defined in [E.164]). The semantics and use cases for the Client-ID are left for future versions of WV specifications. 5.3 Transaction management A WV transaction is a basic communication mechanism between a WV client and a WV SAP. A transaction consists of a request and a response primitive usually. (Exceptions: disconnect, 4-way login.) The purpose of the transaction is to exchange data between the entities or request an operation: usually both within the same transaction. The transactions may originate from either WV client or WV SAP. The transaction consists of request message and response message. Initiator of the transaction should always expect the Status primitive as the result of transaction even if it is not specified explicitly in the description of transaction. This behavior is used to notify the initiator about error caused by the request. The only exception is the Disconnect request from server. The initiating entity, the WV client or the SAP, allocates a transaction identifierthat the responding entity returns in the response message. This links together the requesting message and response message. The originator of the transaction is responsible for maintaining the uniqueness of the transaction identifiers within a session. The response to a request message should be received within 20 seconds from the initiation of the transaction. During or after that period, the requesting entity may resend the request message using the same transaction identifier. The responding entity should guarantee that the requested operation or data is carried out only once, even if multiple request messages with the same transaction identifier are received.  The transactions are sequential until the capability negotiation is completed. Sequential means that one transaction must be complete (closed) before a next one is started (open). A transaction is considered as closed when a the final response primitive has been received, a time out waiting for a response primitive has occurred, or the underlying transport has been detected as “broken.” Multiple transactions mean that two or more transactions are open during the same time. The transactions can be done using the same transport connection or on separate transport connections. 6. Fundamental Primitives 6.1 Status Primitive If an error occurs in the processing party while processing a transaction, it shall respond to the other party with a Status primitive instead of the expected response primitive. The Status primitive is also used as the expected response primitive in some successful transactions. The Result structure always contains one of the status Codes specified in this document. It may also contain a Description string and if necessary, a Detailed description explaining the error. The DetailedResult can be used with every error code but has its main use when the error concerns a specific MessageID, UserID, GroupID or ScreenName. An example is when sending a message to several recipients and one UserID is invalid. The Result could then have status code 201 (Partially successful) and the DetailedResult naming the bad UserID together with status code 531 (Unknown user). The status code 201 (Partially successful) is used when only part of the request was successfully processed. In this case the DetailedResult with all errors must be included but the result of successful parts of the transaction may be omitted. An example is the creation of a contact list with initial contacts. If the server creates the contact list, but fails to add one or more of the contacts, the 201 (Partially successful) with DetailedResult for the bad contacts should be returned. If the server cannot create the contact list at all there was no partial success and the Result code may be for example 701 (Contact list already exists).  When no part of the transaction was successfully processed but the error cannot be described by only one status code, the code 900 (Multiple errors) is used. In this case DetailedResult with all errors must be included. By definition there can be no successful parts and that is the difference from status code 201 (Partially successful). Information Element Req Type Description Message-Type M Status Message identifier  Transaction-ID M String Identifies the transaction. Session-ID O String Session ID for session. Client-ID O Structure Identifies the requesting IM client. Unique (for this user) identifier. Result M Structure The result of the transaction. Table 1. Information elements in Status primitive 6.2 PollingRequest Primitive ClientServerPollingRequest Figure 1. Polling request The polling request is used in transport binding in cases where empty content must be delivered. The exact cases for the use of poll messages are elaborated in the transport-binding document. The polling request follows the basic message structure, but it carries no transaction-ID. Thus, the transaction-ID shall be empty. Information Element Req Type Description Message-Type M PollingRequest Message identifier  Transaction-ID M String Empty content, since Transaction-ID is not carried. Session-ID M String Session ID for session. Table 2. Information elements in PollingRequest primitive 6.3 Logging in 6.3.1 Transactions LoginRequestClientServerLoginResponse Figure 2. Logging in In order to use the IM services the user must log in into a Service Access Point.  After the server processed this request, it sends a login response message to the client; which will contain the details of the login operation. When the login operation into the Service Access Point is not successful, a status message indicates the login failure instead of the login response message. The login response sent by the server may also indicate that the client needs to perform a Client Capability Request. After a successful login a service negotiation performed. After the service negotiation the agreed services available to the user are: Presence Service, IM Service, Group Service, Content Service. When the session is re-initiated, client capability negotiation is not performed. The client may choose either a two-way access control or a four-way access control. If the client chooses the two-way access control, the LoginRequest contains the element “Password-String” with password in plain text. The server responds with either success or failure or further authorization. If the client chooses the four-way access control, the LoginRequest contains neither element “Password-String” nor element “Digest-Bytes”. Instead, the LoginRequest contains the element “Supported Digest Schema”. The server responds with the challenge “nonce” based on the “digest schema”. The server can choose not to use any authentication scheme; instead rely on authentication in the mobile network. In this case the Digest-Schema element indicates “PWD”, and the Nonce element is not present in the LoginResponse primitive. The client then sends the LoginRequest again with the element “Digest-Bytes” which is the BASE64-encoded result string based on the “schema” hash function on the concatenation of the password and the challenge “nonce”. The server finally responds with either “success” or “failure”. Even if the client chooses the two-way access control, the server still can send a response with error code 401. That means the server requires further authorization of this request. In this case, the response message contains the available authorization scheme “digest schema” with the challenge “nonce” for the scheme. Following schemes can be used as “digest schema” to generate the challenge “nonce”: The MD5 Scheme The client concatenates the challenge with the password, and performs a MD5 hash on the resulting string. The client then SHOULD repeat a  request with the resulting data as a string encoded by BASE64. The SHA Scheme The client concatenates the challenge with the password, and performs a SHA hash on the resulting string. The client then SHOULD repeat a request with the resulting data as a string encoded by BASE64. 6.3.2 Error conditions Generic error conditions: q Service unavailable. (503) q Version not supported.

Service request After successful login the client and server must set up the context of the session. Service negotiation must be done after the successful login transaction, and may be repeated during the session at any time. The response to the client confirms what services the server supports and the client is allowed to use. The set of services is structured as a tree. The request of services includes the root of the three (all WV functions) or one or more roots of sub-trees (Service elements or functions). The response to the client are the sub-trees NOT supported by the server, the delta between requested and supported functions, i.e. if all requested functions are supported by the server the response will contain an empty service set. The client can also ask the server for all the services that are supported in the same transaction. The names of the elements are derived from the [WV-CSP-SCR] document.

Client Capability Request Client capability negotiation can be done only once after the successful login transaction. It is up to the server implementation to maintain this information if it is needed every time after login as indicated in the login response. The server has the option to cache the client capability information. The Client Capability Request can also be preformed any time during a session. The client capability request sets up the communication preferences for the session, for example the message delivery method. The Client Capability Request contains an element “Requested Capabilities” that conveys the client capability information to the server. The client capability information includes: • ClientType – the type of the client. See Table 7 in [WV-PA]. • InitialDeliveryMethod – the initial IM delivery method that the recipient client prefers in the set of “PUSH” and “Notify/Get”. • AnyContent – A Boolean value indicating that the client accepts any content types. • AcceptedContentType – the list of supported content types in the client device, such as “text/plain; charset=us-ascii”. Applicable only when Any-Content is “No” or missing. • AcceptedCharset – the list of supported character sets for plain text documents in the client device. Integer number assigned by IANA (see MIBenum numbers in [IANA]). Applicable only when Any-Content  is  “Yes”. • AcceptedTransferEncoding – the supported transfer encoding methods in the client device, such as “base64”. • AcceptedContentLength – the maximum content size when using “PUSH”. Indicates the character (byte) count of the message content. • SupportedBearer – the list of supported bearers (HTTP, WSP, SMS) • MultiTrans – Integer value indicating the maximum number of primitives that the client can handle within the same transport message, as well as the maximum number of open transactions from both client and server side at any given time. The value must be greater than 0. • ParserSize – the maximum character (byte) count of XML message size that the parser can handle. Multiple transactions in the same message and presence updates (many user in the same message) might generate large XML documents. • SupportedCIRMethod – the list of supported CIR methods that are supported by the client. • UDPPort – the client may indicate that it requests other than the default port for the standalone UDP/IP CIR method. It is a decimal integer number. • TCPAddress – If the client indicated that it supports STCP in the request, the server provides an IP address for standalone TCP/IP CIR method. It is an IP address."},{"url":"http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/IMPS/OMA-WV-CSP_DataTypes-V1_1-20021001-A.pdf","file":"OMA-WV-CSP_DataTypes-V1_1-20021001-A.pdf","status":"Approved","version":"V1.1","date":"2002-10-01","contentMediaType":"application/pdf","description":"The Wireless Village Instant Messaging and Presence Service (IMPS) includes four primary features: • Presence • Instant Messaging • Groups • Shared Content Presence is the key enabling technology for IMPS.
