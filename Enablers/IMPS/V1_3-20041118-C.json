It  includes  client  device  availability  (my  phone  is  on/off,  in  a  call),  user  status  (available,  unavailable,  in  a  meeting),  location,  client  device  capabilities  (voice,  text,  GPRS,  multimedia)  and  searchable  personal  statuses  such  as  mood  (happy,  angry)  and  hobbies  (football,  fishing,  computing,  dancing).  Since  presence  information  is  personal,  it  is  only  made  available  according  to  the  user's  wishes - access control features put the control of the user presence information in the users' hands. Instant Messaging (IM) is a familiar concept in both the mobile and desktop worlds. Desktop IM clients, two-way SMS and two-way paging are all forms of Instant Messaging. Wireless Village IM will enable interoperable mobile IM in concert with other innovative features to provide an enhanced user experience. Groups  or  chat  are  a  fun  and  familiar  concept  on  the  Internet.  Both  operators  and  end-users  are  able  to  create  and  manage  groups.  Users  can  invite  their  friends  and  family  to  chat  in  group  discussions.  Operators  can  build  common interest groups where end-users can meet each other online. Shared Content allows users and operators to setup their own storage area where they can post pictures, music and  other  multimedia  content  while  enabling  the  sharing  with  other  individuals  and  groups  in  an  IM  or  chat  session. These features, taken in part or as a whole, provide the basis for innovative new services that build upon a common interoperable framework. These  features,  taken  in  part  or  as  a  whole,  provide  the  basis  for  innovative  new  services  that  build  upon  a  common interoperable framework. The  OMA  IMPS  Specification  Version  1.2  is  the  latest  standard  that  defines  technological  framework  and  the  protocol to build the IMPS service. The features and functions for OMA IMPS v1.2 are defined in [IMPSF&F] but there  is  still  some  room  for  optimization  and  improvement.  This  document  identifies  some  high-level  use  cases  that are not fulfilled in IMPS v1.2 and define the requirements that should be considered as such optimization and improvement possibility – which will be included in OMA IMPS v1.3. The document does not include requirements from  the  previous  versions  of  the  specifications.  It  is  a  ‘delta’  requirement  document  meaning  that  requirements  are included only for those features, which are going to be changed."}]}}
