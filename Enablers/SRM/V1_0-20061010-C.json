The scope of OMA “Digital Rights Management” (DRM) is to enable the distribution and consumption of digital content in a controlled manner. The content is distributed and consumed on authenticated Devices per the usage rights expressed by the content owners. This specification defines the requirement for the OMA DRM based Secure Removable Media to extend the OMA DRM 2.0 to enable the use of OMA DRM based Secure Removable Media.  OMA DRM with Secure Removable Media enables the protection and consumption of digital content and its usage rights in Secure Removable Media in a secure manner. This specification is not stand-alone; it must be interpreted in the context of the existing OMA DRM v2.0 suite of specifications."}]}}
