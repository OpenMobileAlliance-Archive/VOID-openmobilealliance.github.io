The document will maintain the compatibility with the existing WAP Push architecture; push message definitions, service definitions, charging [OMACharging]. Push Proxy Gateway Service specification [PPGService] defines PPG operations, which defines each push submission processing, before sending the push content to the client. It is out of the scope of SIP Based Push RD to define any new push submission processing."}]}}
