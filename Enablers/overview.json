Introduction  The purpose of this document is to provide client conformance test cases for \"Mobile Broadcast Services version 1.0\". BCAST is a complex enabler which requires tests for conformance and interoperability in a client/server scenario with different access networks. Some features in the BCAST enabler may optionally be implemented in mobile devices.  The tests associated with these optional features are marked as [Optional] in the test specification. Terminals that support ESG delivery using both Broadcast and Interaction Channel are required to run all applicable test cases using both ESG delivery methods.

Continuation of / Can be tested at the same time as: 5.10.3.5 – Pull LTKM delivery Prerequisite for this test: 5.10.3.5 – Pull LTKM delivery Test Procedure 1. The terminal receives continuous STKMs stream for the service with the Key domain ID= MCC1|| MNC1.  TEK ID of STKM is incremented for each TEK renewal with a cryptoperiod of 10s. Within a crypto period TEK ID is not changed (STKM sent every second; i.e 10 times within the crypto period) but TS changes for each STKM within the crypto period. TS starts with 0x00 00 00 01 and TEK_ID with 0x00 01. If this requires too much processing on the server side, it is also possible to test without TS change during the crypto period but with for example an increment of 10 for each cryptoperiod Pass-Criteria 1. Video is displayed by the terminal for a time period of 20s. If the video is displayed during 15*10=150s, this means that TEK ID field is used for the checking of KV of SEK/PEK, instead of TS, which is an error. 5.10.3.7      Deregistration       Test Case Id BCAST-1.0-ServProt-121g Test Object BCAST Terminal Test Case Description Test that a deregistration flow can be processed by the terminal.

scope of this document is limited to the Enabler Release Definition of IMPS according to OMA Release process and the Enabler Release specification baseline listed in section 5.  The Wireless Village Instant Messaging and Presence Service (IMPS) includes four primary features: • Presence • Instant Messaging • Groups • Shared Content Presence is the key enabling technology for IMPS. It includes client device availability (my phone is on/off, in a call), user status (available, unavailable, in a meeting), location, client device capabilities (voice, text, GPRS, multimedia) and searchable personal statuses such as mood (happy, angry) and hobbies (football, fishing, computing, dancing). Since presence information is personal, it is only made available according to the user's wishes - access control features put the control of the user presence information in the users' hands. Instant Messaging (IM) is a familiar concept in both the mobile and desktop worlds. Desktop IM clients, two-way SMS and two-way paging are all forms of Instant Messaging. Wireless Village IM will enable interoperable mobile IM in concert with other innovative features to provide an enhanced user experience. Groups or chat are a fun and familiar concept on the Internet. Both operators and end-users are able to create and manage groups. Users can invite their friends and family to chat in group discussions. Operators can build common interest groups where end-users can meet each other online.

Terminology and Conventions 3.1 Conventions The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. All sections and appendixes, except “Scope” and “Introduction”, are normative, unless they are explicitly indicated to be informative. 3.2 Definitions None 3.3 Abbreviations  None 4. Introduction  This document describes the transactions and the information elements in transactions that are used to provide Wireless Village services and the interoperability of different implementations. 5. WV session 5.1 Session management The Wireless Village session is a framework in which the WV services are provided to the WV client. The WV session is transport-independent. If the transport connection is broken, the client can reconnect and continue the session. The client device may be even turned on and off and the session may still be continued. The WV session is established when the client logs in and terminated when either the client logs out or the SAP decides to disconnect the session. The session is identified by a Session-ID. In addition, the WV client provides at login phase a client-unique session cookie for the session, which is used by the server to trigger communications in some cases. The authentication of the user is done at the login phase. The authentication is, in general, considered to be valid throughout the session. However, the server may, at any time disconnect the session and request the client to re-login. In this case, the client provides the old session-ID. After valid authentication, the WV server may accept to reestablish the old session. During the WV session, both the client and SAP have to maintain session context. The session context contains dynamic information of the services the client is currently using. The WV specifications do not explicitly define what is the actual state of services the session context contains, but it assumes that the negotiated services for the session are valid throughout the session. The session context in the WV server and the WV client are tied together by the services the user is currently using (subscribed presence attributes, joined groups, authorized presence attributes, etc). The WV server and WV client may assume that the link between the contexts is valid throughout the WV session as well as reestablished session. When the session is terminated and a new session is established, the WV server may still maintain some services, such as subscribed presence attributes. This is an implementation issue in the WV server. 5.2 Addressing 5.2.1 Introduction The Wireless Village addressing model introduces an unique WV address space. The definition of the addresses is based on the URI format [RFC2396]. The addressable entities are: • User • Contact list • User group (private and public) • Content (private and public) Use of other address spaces may be used to interoperate with other systems, but their use is out of the scope of Wireless Village specifications. In addition to the user, the WV client the user is using may be addressed as well. In this specification version, the client identification is defined but its exact semantics and use cases are left for next WV specification release. 5.2.2 Generic address format The generic address syntax is based on URI [RFC2396]. The wv-schema in the URI indicates the use of wv-addressing space. The generic syntax is defined as follows: Address = \"wv:\" [User-ID] [\"/\" Resource] [\"@\" Domain] Resource = Group-ID | Contact-List-ID | Content-ID Domain = sub-domain *(“.” sub-domain)  where User-ID refers to the identification of the WV user, Domain identifies the WV server domain, and Resource further identifies the referred public or private resource within the domain. The sub-domain is defined in [RFC822]. When the User-ID is present without the Resource, the address refers to the user. When User-ID is present with Resource, the address refers to the private resource of the user. When User-ID is not present, the Resource must always be present and then the address refers to a public resource within the domain. The Domain part is optional. When it is not present, the address refers implicitly to the home domain. The addresses are case insensitive. 5.2.3  Address encoding As per URI [RFC2396], certain reserved characters must be escaped if they occur within the User-ID, Resource, or Domain portions of a Wireless Village address. This includes the characters “;”, “?”, “:”, “&”, “=”, “+”, “$” and “,”. For example, a valid Wireless Village address for the user “$mith” in the “server.com” domain is: wv:%24mith@server.com   Certain characters are not allowed in the User-ID portion of Wireless Village addresses (see 4.2.4, below). This includes the characters “/”, “@”, “+”, “ “ and TAB. This restriction is independent of the encoding of a User-ID within a Wireless Village address. For example, this Wireless Village address is not permissible: wv:john%40aol.com@server.com  This address is not permissible because after URI-decoding, the User-ID portion contains a forbidden character (“@”). If a server’s internal representation of a username permits the occurrence of forbidden characters, such characters must be double-escaped when they occur in a Wireless Village address, such that they do not occur unescaped in the User-ID portion after URI-decoding, or they must be escaped via some other scheme that does not employ forbidden characters. 5.2.4 User addressing CSP uses User-IDs to uniquely identify any WV User. The User-ID is syntactically equivalent to an e-mail address, and as such is subject to the same restrictions for character set, as described in “Standard for the Format of ARPA Internet Text Messages” [RFC822]. The User ID is either a local User ID which is the domain that the client is logged on (home-domain) or an external User ID, which is on another domain. The User-ID either refers to the Internet-type address or to a mobile number of the user. If the User-ID refers to the mobile number of the user, the user name always starts either with a digit or with a '+' sign. A user name referring to Internet-type address may not start with a '+' sign or digit. The syntax if the User-ID is defined as follows: User-ID = Mobile-Identity | Internet-Identity Internet-Identity = *alpha  Mobile-Identity = (digit | \"+\") *digit digit = \"0\" | \"1\" | \"2\" |\"3\" |\"4\" |\"5\" |\"6\" |\"7\" |\"8\" | \"9\" alpha = Any ISO 8859-1 character except specials specials = \"/\" | \"@\" | \"+\" | \" \" | TAB  When the User-ID refers to the mobile number address, the User-ID preceded with '+' sign refers to the international numbering in The International Public Telecommunication Numbering Plan [E.164]. Without '+' sign, it refers to the national numbering in the [E.164]. Examples: Local-User-ID: wv:yuriyt  wv:+1234567890  wv:4567890 External-User-ID: wv:Jon.Smith@imps.com  wv:+1234567890@imps.com  wv:4567890@imps.com The users may also be identified by screen names, nicknames and aliases. These identifiers explicitly and implicitly refer to the User-ID. ScreenName – the combination of a name a user chooses in a group session, and the Group-ID itself. The user may have different ScreenNames on different occasions as well as on different groups. The ScreenName is always connected to a group. NickName – A name that is used internally in a client to hide the UserID of contacts. When a ContactList is stored on the server the NickName must have a space. It is not possible to address a NickName. Alias – The name a user suggest others to use as NickName. Part of the User Presence. 5.2.5 Contact List Addressing The CSP uses Contact List IDs to uniquely identify any contact list of any user. The contact list ID is based on the generic address syntax. The contact list may be a public contact list ora private contact list. The syntax is defined as follows: Contact-List-ID = *alpha Examples for the contact list IDs are: wv:john/colleagues@imps.com wv:/managers wv:john/friends wv:/managers@imps.com  5.2.6 User Group The CSP uses a Group ID to uniquely identify a group. The Group-ID is based on the generic address syntax. The user group may be public user group or private user group. The syntax of the group ID is defined as follows: Group-ID = *alpha Examples of the Group-IDs are: wv:john/mygroup@imps.com ww:john/mygroup wv:/technicalforum wv:/technical_forum@imps.com  5.2.7 Content Addressing The CSP uses a Content ID to uniquely identify a group. The Content ID is based on the generic address syntax. The syntax of the Content ID is as follows: Content-ID = *alpha Examples of the Content IDs are: wv:john/WV_presentation wv:john/WV_presentation@imps.com wv:/wvspec wv:/wvspec@imps.com  5.2.8 Client Addressing The client-ID is a unique identifier of the WV client that the user is currently using. It identifies the WV client as an application and its location that accesses the WV services. The client-ID is intended to allow: • Multiple access from the same user • Direct application-to-application communication. The Client-ID consists of • An optional application identifier as a URL identifying the application and its location. • An optional mobile device identity (such as international mobile number defined in [E.164]). The semantics and use cases for the Client-ID are left for future versions of WV specifications. 5.3 Transaction management A WV transaction is a basic communication mechanism between a WV client and a WV SAP. A transaction consists of a request and a response primitive usually. (Exceptions: disconnect, 4-way login.) The purpose of the transaction is to exchange data between the entities or request an operation: usually both within the same transaction. The transactions may originate from either WV client or WV SAP. The transaction consists of request message and response message. Initiator of the transaction should always expect the Status primitive as the result of transaction even if it is not specified explicitly in the description of transaction. This behavior is used to notify the initiator about error caused by the request. The only exception is the Disconnect request from server. The initiating entity, the WV client or the SAP, allocates a transaction identifierthat the responding entity returns in the response message. This links together the requesting message and response message. The originator of the transaction is responsible for maintaining the uniqueness of the transaction identifiers within a session. The response to a request message should be received within 20 seconds from the initiation of the transaction. During or after that period, the requesting entity may resend the request message using the same transaction identifier. The responding entity should guarantee that the requested operation or data is carried out only once, even if multiple request messages with the same transaction identifier are received.  The transactions are sequential until the capability negotiation is completed. Sequential means that one transaction must be complete (closed) before a next one is started (open). A transaction is considered as closed when a the final response primitive has been received, a time out waiting for a response primitive has occurred, or the underlying transport has been detected as “broken.” Multiple transactions mean that two or more transactions are open during the same time. The transactions can be done using the same transport connection or on separate transport connections. 6. Fundamental Primitives 6.1 Status Primitive If an error occurs in the processing party while processing a transaction, it shall respond to the other party with a Status primitive instead of the expected response primitive. The Status primitive is also used as the expected response primitive in some successful transactions. The Result structure always contains one of the status Codes specified in this document. It may also contain a Description string and if necessary, a Detailed description explaining the error. The DetailedResult can be used with every error code but has its main use when the error concerns a specific MessageID, UserID, GroupID or ScreenName. An example is when sending a message to several recipients and one UserID is invalid. The Result could then have status code 201 (Partially successful) and the DetailedResult naming the bad UserID together with status code 531 (Unknown user). The status code 201 (Partially successful) is used when only part of the request was successfully processed. In this case the DetailedResult with all errors must be included but the result of successful parts of the transaction may be omitted. An example is the creation of a contact list with initial contacts. If the server creates the contact list, but fails to add one or more of the contacts, the 201 (Partially successful) with DetailedResult for the bad contacts should be returned. If the server cannot create the contact list at all there was no partial success and the Result code may be for example 701 (Contact list already exists).  When no part of the transaction was successfully processed but the error cannot be described by only one status code, the code 900 (Multiple errors) is used. In this case DetailedResult with all errors must be included. By definition there can be no successful parts and that is the difference from status code 201 (Partially successful). Information Element Req Type Description Message-Type M Status Message identifier  Transaction-ID M String Identifies the transaction. Session-ID O String Session ID for session. Client-ID O Structure Identifies the requesting IM client. Unique (for this user) identifier. Result M Structure The result of the transaction. Table 1. Information elements in Status primitive 6.2 PollingRequest Primitive ClientServerPollingRequest Figure 1. Polling request The polling request is used in transport binding in cases where empty content must be delivered. The exact cases for the use of poll messages are elaborated in the transport-binding document. The polling request follows the basic message structure, but it carries no transaction-ID. Thus, the transaction-ID shall be empty. Information Element Req Type Description Message-Type M PollingRequest Message identifier  Transaction-ID M String Empty content, since Transaction-ID is not carried. Session-ID M String Session ID for session. Table 2. Information elements in PollingRequest primitive 6.3 Logging in 6.3.1 Transactions LoginRequestClientServerLoginResponse Figure 2. Logging in In order to use the IM services the user must log in into a Service Access Point.  After the server processed this request, it sends a login response message to the client; which will contain the details of the login operation. When the login operation into the Service Access Point is not successful, a status message indicates the login failure instead of the login response message. The login response sent by the server may also indicate that the client needs to perform a Client Capability Request. After a successful login a service negotiation performed. After the service negotiation the agreed services available to the user are: Presence Service, IM Service, Group Service, Content Service. When the session is re-initiated, client capability negotiation is not performed. The client may choose either a two-way access control or a four-way access control. If the client chooses the two-way access control, the LoginRequest contains the element “Password-String” with password in plain text. The server responds with either success or failure or further authorization. If the client chooses the four-way access control, the LoginRequest contains neither element “Password-String” nor element “Digest-Bytes”. Instead, the LoginRequest contains the element “Supported Digest Schema”. The server responds with the challenge “nonce” based on the “digest schema”. The server can choose not to use any authentication scheme; instead rely on authentication in the mobile network. In this case the Digest-Schema element indicates “PWD”, and the Nonce element is not present in the LoginResponse primitive. The client then sends the LoginRequest again with the element “Digest-Bytes” which is the BASE64-encoded result string based on the “schema” hash function on the concatenation of the password and the challenge “nonce”. The server finally responds with either “success” or “failure”. Even if the client chooses the two-way access control, the server still can send a response with error code 401. That means the server requires further authorization of this request. In this case, the response message contains the available authorization scheme “digest schema” with the challenge “nonce” for the scheme. Following schemes can be used as “digest schema” to generate the challenge “nonce”: The MD5 Scheme The client concatenates the challenge with the password, and performs a MD5 hash on the resulting string. The client then SHOULD repeat a  request with the resulting data as a string encoded by BASE64. The SHA Scheme The client concatenates the challenge with the password, and performs a SHA hash on the resulting string. The client then SHOULD repeat a request with the resulting data as a string encoded by BASE64. 6.3.2 Error conditions Generic error conditions: q Service unavailable. (503) q Version not supported.

Service request After successful login the client and server must set up the context of the session. Service negotiation must be done after the successful login transaction, and may be repeated during the session at any time. The response to the client confirms what services the server supports and the client is allowed to use. The set of services is structured as a tree. The request of services includes the root of the three (all WV functions) or one or more roots of sub-trees (Service elements or functions). The response to the client are the sub-trees NOT supported by the server, the delta between requested and supported functions, i.e. if all requested functions are supported by the server the response will contain an empty service set. The client can also ask the server for all the services that are supported in the same transaction. The names of the elements are derived from the [WV-CSP-SCR] document.

Client Capability Request Client capability negotiation can be done only once after the successful login transaction. It is up to the server implementation to maintain this information if it is needed every time after login as indicated in the login response. The server has the option to cache the client capability information. The Client Capability Request can also be preformed any time during a session. The client capability request sets up the communication preferences for the session, for example the message delivery method. The Client Capability Request contains an element “Requested Capabilities” that conveys the client capability information to the server. The client capability information includes: • ClientType – the type of the client. See Table 7 in [WV-PA]. • InitialDeliveryMethod – the initial IM delivery method that the recipient client prefers in the set of “PUSH” and “Notify/Get”. • AnyContent – A Boolean value indicating that the client accepts any content types. • AcceptedContentType – the list of supported content types in the client device, such as “text/plain; charset=us-ascii”. Applicable only when Any-Content is “No” or missing. • AcceptedCharset – the list of supported character sets for plain text documents in the client device. Integer number assigned by IANA (see MIBenum numbers in [IANA]). Applicable only when Any-Content  is  “Yes”. • AcceptedTransferEncoding – the supported transfer encoding methods in the client device, such as “base64”. • AcceptedContentLength – the maximum content size when using “PUSH”. Indicates the character (byte) count of the message content. • SupportedBearer – the list of supported bearers (HTTP, WSP, SMS) • MultiTrans – Integer value indicating the maximum number of primitives that the client can handle within the same transport message, as well as the maximum number of open transactions from both client and server side at any given time. The value must be greater than 0. • ParserSize – the maximum character (byte) count of XML message size that the parser can handle. Multiple transactions in the same message and presence updates (many user in the same message) might generate large XML documents. • SupportedCIRMethod – the list of supported CIR methods that are supported by the client. • UDPPort – the client may indicate that it requests other than the default port for the standalone UDP/IP CIR method. It is a decimal integer number. • TCPAddress – If the client indicated that it supports STCP in the request, the server provides an IP address for standalone TCP/IP CIR method. It is an IP address."},{"url":"http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/IMPS/OMA-WV-CSP_DataTypes-V1_1-20021001-A.pdf","file":"OMA-WV-CSP_DataTypes-V1_1-20021001-A.pdf","status":"Approved","version":"V1.1","date":"2002-10-01","contentMediaType":"application/pdf","description":"The Wireless Village Instant Messaging and Presence Service (IMPS) includes four primary features: • Presence • Instant Messaging • Groups • Shared Content Presence is the key enabling technology for IMPS.

This document, namely the “OMA Web Services Enabler (OWSER): Network Identity Specifications” document, provides the specifications of the components needed to provide aspects of the Network Identity related capabilities of the OWSER, as described in [OWSEROvw]. This document is intended to provide normative guidance to designers of specific OMA Network Identity Web Services and implementers thereof."},{"url":"http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/OWSER/OMA-OWSER-Overview-V1_0-20040316-C.pdf","file":"OMA-OWSER-Overview-V1_0-20040316-C.pdf","status":"Candidate","version":"V1.0","date":"2004-03-16","contentMediaType":"application/pdf","description":"This document, entitled \"OMA Web Services Enabler (OWSER): Overview,\" is part of a group of documents [OWSERSpec] [OWSERNI] and [OWSERBP] that together describe and specify components of the OMA Web Services Enabler (OWSER).  This OWSER Overview is informative and provides an overview of the OWSER and the Web Service technologies that will be used to publish, discover and use components that support Mobile Web Services in a secure manner. It is intended to complement the normative text found in the companion OWSER Specifications. The OMA Web Services Enabler defines the means by which OMA applications can be exposed, discovered and consumed using Web Services technologies.  The purpose of the OWSER is to provide designers of Web Services within OMA with solutions to common functionality using Web Services technologies.  Without such a framework, designers of Web Services within OMA would almost certainly try to solve these problems on their own, each in their own way.  Such an effort would inevitably lead to brittle implementations, interoperability problems, and increased time to market. The goals of the OWSER are consistent with those expressed in the OMA Service Enabler Strategy White Paper [OMASES]. The document entitled \"OMA Web Services Enabler (OWSER): Core Specifications\" [OWSERSpec] provides the specifications of the components needed to provide the capabilities of the OWSER as identified in this document, in particular the normative use of Web Service technologies to implement such capabilities.  The document entitled \"OMA Web Services Enabler (OWSER): Network Identity Specifications\" [OWSERNI] specifies the components needed to support the aspects of Network Identity related to capabilities of the OWSER. The document entitled \"OMA Web Services Enabler (OSWER) Best Practices: WSDL Style Guide\" [OWSERBP] provides informative guidelines on the use of the Web Services Description Language [WSDL] that may be used by OMA-defined Web Services. While the normative definition of technologies specified in the OWSER is rightly provided in the specification documents themselves ([OWSERSpec] and [OWSERNI]), the Overview provides some information on technologies which are considered to be within the scope or outside the scope of the current OWSER release.  In particular, Sections 7, 7.1, and 7.2.2 contain specific scope information."},{"url":"http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/OWSER/OMA-OWSER-V1_0-20040316-C.zip","file":"OMA-OWSER-V1_0-20040316-C.zip","status":"Candidate","version":"V1.0","date":"2004-03-16","contentMediaType":"application/zip"},{"url":"http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/OWSER/OMA-RD_MWS_NI-V1_0-20031120-A.pdf","file":"OMA-RD_MWS_NI-V1_0-20031120-A.pdf","status":"Approved","version":"V1.0","date":"2003-11-20","contentMediaType":"application/pdf","description":"This

Because this specification does not define any security mechanisms, care must be taken when including user-confidential information1 in the profile unless the profile is transmitted over an end-to-end secure channel (e.g. TLS/WTLS to the origin server). • An implicit chain of trust exists between the client and origin server. The integrity of the profile is maintained (in other words, not compromised) as it is transmitted through or cached within the network.

For optimum security, some parts of the security functionality need to be performed by a tamper-resistant device, so that an attacker cannot retrieve sensitive data. Such data is especially the permanent private keys used in the WTLS handshake with client authentication, and for making application level electronic signatures (such as confirming an application level transaction). In WTLS, also the master secrets, protecting secure sessions, are relatively long living – which could be several days. This is in order to avoid frequent full handshakes which are relatively heavy both computationally and due to large data transfer. Master secrets are used as a source of entropy, to calculate MAC keys and message encryption keys which are used to secure a limited number of messages, depending on usage of WTLS.    The WAP Identity Module (WIM) is used in performing WTLS, TLS and application level security functions, and especially, to store and process information needed for user identification and authentication. The functionality presented here is based on the requirement that sensitive data, especially keys, can be stored in the WIM, and all operations where these keys are involved can be performed in the WIM.   An example of a WIM implementation is a smart card. In the phone, it can be the Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card or an external smart card. The way which a phone and a smart card interact is specified as a command-response protocol, using Application Protocol Data Units (APDU) specific to this application. This specification is based on ISO7816 series of standards on smart cards and the related GSM specifications [GSM11.11], where applicable.   This specification concentrates on defining an interface between the part of a WAP client device that is not considered tamper-resistant, and a tamper-resistant component, the WIM.   A basic requirement for WIM implementation is that it is tamper-resistant. This means that certain physical hardware protection is used, which makes it unfeasible to extract or modify information in the module (volatile, non-volatile memory and other parts). Technology used in smart cards are examples of this kind of protection. Regular mobile phones and PDAs cannot be considered tamper-resistant. For these devices, e.g. extracting information from the module may be difficult but still feasible with a proper equipment.  This specification does not define exact requirements for tamper-resistance. Businesses can enforce certain requirements and policies using PKI based mechanisms. Applications should only accept certificates signed by Certification Authorities that are known to fulfil the requirements and policies.  PKI functionality (including WTLS and TLS client authentication with private keys, and WMLScript and ECMAScript digital signatures) can be implemented in pure software in normal PDAs or phones, using password protection, encryption etc. However, such implementations cannot be considered as WIM implementations, and are out of scope of this specification. At the same time, service interfaces defined in this specification may be useful for designing internal software interfaces for these implementations."},{"url":"http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/WPKI/OMA-WPKI-V1_0-20040615-C.zip","file":"OMA-WPKI-V1_0-20040615-C.zip","status":"Candidate","version":"V1.0","date":"2004-06-15","contentMediaType":"application/zip"},{"url":"http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/WPKI/README.txt","file":"README.txt","status":"","version":"","date":"","contentMediaType":"text/plain"},{"url":"http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/WPKI/WAP-161-WMLScriptCrypto-20010620-a.pdf","file":"WAP-161-WMLScriptCrypto-20010620-a.pdf","status":"","version":"","date":"","contentMediaType":"application/pdf","description":"Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) is a result of continuous work to define an industry-wide specification for developing applications that operate over wireless communication networks.

The current library specification supports digital signature functionality . Other functionality (like encryption/decryption or symmetric key based MAC) may be added in future versions.  5.1  signText 5.1.1  Introduction  Many kinds of applications, e.g., electronic commerce, require the ability to provide persistent proof that someone has authorised a transaction. Although WTLS [WAPWTLS] provides transient client authentication for the duration of a WTLS connection, it does not provide persistent authentication for transactions that may occur during that connection. One way to provide such authentication is to associate a digital signature with data generated as the result of a transaction, such as a purchase order or other financial document.   To support this requirement, the browser provides a WMLScript function, Crypto.signText, that asks the user to sign a string of text. A call to the signText method displays the exact text to be signed and asks the user to confirm that. After the data has been signed and both the signature and the data have been sent across the network, the server can extract the digital signature and validate it, and possibly store it for accountability purposes.   The browser SHOULD use special signature keys that are distinct from authentication keys used for WTLS. A WIM [WAPWIM] may be used for private key storage and signature computation.

Page 10(27)  5.1.2  signText function definition   Function: signedString = Crypto.signText(stringToSign, options, keyIdType, keyId) Function ID: 16 Description: The function requests that a user digitally signs a text string. The calling script provides the text to sign (stringToSign) which MUST be displayed to the user. The user may choose either to cancel or approve the signing operation. If several certificates are available that match the criteria indicated in parameters, the choices should be indicated to the user, using e.g., labels of the certificates. If the user approves the operation, the browser MUST ask for user verification information for the private key (e.g., the WIM PIN for a non-repudiation key). If the user enters the correct information, signText signs the specified string and returns signedString to the script as String, formatted as base-64 [RFC1521] encoding of SignedContent.     (c) 2001 Wireless Application Protocol Forum, Ltd All rights reserved. Page 11(27) Parameters: stringToSign = String A string which MUST be displayed to the user. In case the string is a concatenation of strings in different character sets, the implementation has to convert the string to a certain single encoding, before processing in this function. The recommended encoding method is UTF-8 [UTF8].  options = Integer Contains several option values, ORed together: 0x0001 – INCLUDE_CONTENT. If this option is set, the browser MUST include the stringToSign in the result. 0x0002 – INCLUDE_KEY_HASH. If this option is set, the browser MUST include the hash of the public key corresponding to the signature key in the result. 0x0004 – INCLUDE_CERTIFICATE. If this option is set, the browser MUST include the certificate or a URL of the certificate in the result (whether the browser includes the certificate content or a URL depends on which one is available). If the browser does not have access to a certificate, it MUST return “error:noCert”. keyIdType = Integer Indicates the type of a key identifier: 0 – NONE. No key identifier is supplied. The browser may use any key and certificate available. 1 – USER_KEY_HASH. A SHA-1 hash of the user public key is supplied in the next parameter. The browser MUST use the signature key that corresponds to the given public key hash or, if this key is not available, return “error:noCert”. 2 – TRUSTED_KEY_HASH. A SHA-1 hash of a trusted CA public key (or multiple of them) is supplied in the next parameter. The browser MUST use a signature key that is certified by the indicated CA (or some of them). If no such key is available, the browser MUST return “error:noCert”.  keyId = String Identifies the key in a way based on the previous parameter.  For a SHA-1 public key hash, contains the 20-byte hash. Multiple values may be  concatenated. Number of elements in the list is implied by the length of the parameter.

The content of the return string is the following • in case of a succesful operation, the base-64 [RFC1521] encoding of SignedContent • if there is no proper certificate or signature key available, the string “error:noCert” • if the user cancelled the operation, the string “error:userCancel” Exceptions: Errors in parameters, encoding or internal errors result in an invalid return value. Example: var foo = Crypto.signText(\"Bill of Sale\\n------------------\\n3 Bolognese $18.00\\n1 Pepperoni  $7.00\\n4 Lemonade   $6.00\\n------------------\\nTotal Price $31.00\",  0, 1, \"\\x37\\x00\\xB6\\x96\\x37\\x75\\xE3\\x93\\x48\\x74\\xD3\\x98\\x47\\x53\\x94\\x34\\x58\\x97\\xB5\\xD6\"); // The application indicates the signature key    5.1.3   Handling of Certificates For verification of the digital signature, the server must have access to a user’s certificate that is signed by a Certification Authority (CA) recognised by the server. There are several possibilities for how the server can get access to the user’s certificate: 1. The certificate is appended to the signature.  2. The public key hash is appended to the signature. The server is able to fetch the corresponding certificate from a certificate service. 3. A URL of the certificate is appended to the signature. The server is able to fetch the certificate using internet methods. 4. The server knows the user certificate based on a previous data exchange with the user, e.g., a previous digital signature.   5.1.4   Implementation using the WIM This chapter describes how to implement the signText function using the WIM [WAPWIM].   A non-repudiation key is used for signing. This implies usage of a an authentication object used for this key only, and that the verification requirement cannot be disabled. E.g., in case of a PIN, the PIN MUST be entered separately for each signature operation.  The PKCS#15 key ID (commonObjectAttributes.id) has the value of the public key hash. So, it can be used to find the proper key or certificate, if the key is identified by USER_KEY_HASH. The certificate issuer public key hash (PKCS15CommonCertificateAttributes.requestId) can be used to find a proper certificate, if it is identified by TRUSTED_KEY_HASH.  Labels, contained in entries that describe private keys and certificates (commonObjectAttributes.label) SHOULD be used to display options to use for signing.

It is described below using WTLS presentation [WAPWTLS]. Hash values of authenticated attributes are computed using a PKCS#7 template to provide end-to-end authentication between WAP clients and devices supporting the PKCS#7 standard for signed data representation.  enum {null(0), rsa_sha_pkcs1(1), ecdsa_sha_p1363(2), (255)} DataSignatureAlgorithm;  Item Description null No signature present. rsa_sha_pkcs1 The signature is calculated according to [PKCS1] (see Appendix B), using octet string output. ecdsa_sha The signature is calculated according to [X9.62], using octet string output.   struct {   DataSignatureAlgorithm algorithm;   switch (algorithm) {    case null: struct {};    default: opaque signature<0..2^16-1>;   }; } Signature;   enum { implicit(0), sha_key_hash(1), wtls_certificate(2), x509_certificate(3), x968_certificate(4), certificate_url(5), (255)} SignerInfoType;  Item Description implicit The signer is implied by the content. sha_key_hash The SHA-1 hash of the public key,  encoded as specified in [WAPWTLS].  wtls_certificate A WTLS certificate. x509_certificate An X.509v3  certificate. x968_certificate An X9.68 certificate. certificate_url A URL where the certificate is located.  struct {  SignerInfoType signer_info_type;  switch (signer_info_type) {    (c) 2001 Wireless Application Protocol Forum, Ltd All rights reserved.

For data type of content, indicates a specific content type (assigned values are not defined yet).  content_present Indicates if the content is present in the structure. content Content.

Only the 12 actual date/time octet values are included; the trailing ‘Z’, indicating GMT or Zulu, is omitted since it is implicit. signer_nonce A nonce generated by the signer. This attribute MAY be used by devices that do not have an internal clock.   struct {  AttributeType attribute_type;  switch (attribute_type) {   case gmt_utc_time: uint8[12];   case signer_nonce: opaque signer_nonce[8];   } } AuthenticatedAttribute;   struct {  uint8 version;  Signature signature;  SignerInfo signer_infos<0..2^16-1>;  ContentInfo content_info;   AuthenticatedAttribute authenticated_attributes<0..255>; } SignedContent;  Item Description version Version of the SignedContent structure. For this specification the version is 1. signature Signature signer_infos Information on the signer. This may contain zero items (in case the signer is implicit). Also, there may be multiple items of SignerInfo present (public key hash and a certificate). content_info Information about the content being signed. The actual content is optionally included in the structure. authenticated_ attributes Attributes that are included in the signature.  6.1.  Usage with signText The result returned by signText is formatted as SignedContent.  The original stringToSign is optionally included in the structure. It is the responsibility of the application that the verifying party (server) will have access both to the original text and the signature. The text may be generated in the    (c) 2001 Wireless Application Protocol Forum, Ltd All rights reserved. Page 17(27) server and cached there. Or, if the text is generated in the client (e.g., based on user input), it should be included in the structure.  The verification service must take the character set into account. If the original service generated the stringToSign, it is necessary to convert that to a proper character set encoding.  6.2.  Hash Calculation and Relationship to PKCS#7 SignedData The signed content type is defined so as to allow end-to-end authentication of signed content based on PKCS#7 [PKCS7] signed data structures. A proxy server or gateway may accept a PKCS#7 signed data object and convert to the WAP signed content type without violating the end-to-end integrity of the signature. This is done by compressing the PKCS#7 header (by representing it in WTLS encoding format) without information loss. Since the mobile device can reconstruct the original header with any authenticated attributes it can verify the original signature.   When a mobile device is sending signed content it constructs the PKCS#7 header using a static template and filing in the relevant attribute values. The hash is computed as specified in [PKCS7]. The mobile device then formats and sends the SignedContent type. This allows a proxy or gateway to convert this back to PKCS#7 format for transmission to a server. In this way we achieve both bandwidth efficiency and limited parsing requirements on the mobile device while enabling end-to-end signed content verification with servers not supporting the WAP signed content type.  The hash calculation on the mobile device is performed as defined in [PKCS7], using the signer's authenticated attributes. This requires that the input for the hash calculation is represented in ASN.1 DER encoding. As shown below, complex DER encoding is not required, since the length of the values are known beforehand. An implementation needs only the (static)  PKCS#7 DER structure, filing in the variable fields. It need not understand the specifics of the ASN.1 encoding.  According to [PKCS7], the mandatory authenticated attributes are the contentType and messageDigest attributes (hash of the original data). Additionally, either signing time or a random nonce MUST be used as an authenticated attribute. Signing time is recommended. A random number MAY be used by implementations that do not support real time clock.   The message-digesting process computes a message digest on the content together with the signer's authenticated attributes. The initial input to the message-digesting process is the value of the content being signed.   The authenticated attributes are the following [PKCS9].  Attribute OID OID in Binary contentType pkcs9-3 2a 86 48 86 f7 0d 01 09 03 messageDigest pkcs9-4 2a 86 48 86 f7 0d 01 09 04 signingTime pkcs9-5 2a 86 48 86 f7 0d 01 09 05 signerNonce pkcs9-25-3 2a 86 48 86 f7 0d 01 09 19 03   To calculate the hash, the signer uses the following buffer as a template:    (c) 2001 Wireless Application Protocol Forum, Ltd All rights reserved. Page 18(27)  31 5d    30 18       06 09 2a 86 48 86 f7 0d 01 09 03 – contentType       31 0b          06 09 2a 86 48 86 f7 0d 01 07 01 -- data    30 1c       06 09 2a 86 48 86 f7 0d 01 09 05 – signingTime       31 0f          17 0d XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX -- UTCTime     30 23       06 09 2a 86 48 86 f7 0d 01 09 04 – messageDigest       31 16          04 14 XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX                 -- SHA-1 digest  In order to construct the input for hash calculation, the following steps are performed • use initially a 95-byte buffer as above (bytes 1...95) • replace bytes 46...58 with the value of UTC time expressed as YYMMDDHHMMSSZ (ASCII-encoded) • replace bytes 76...95 with the 20-byte value of the SHA-1 hash of the content value  The next step is to calculate the hash from the above 95-byte buffer. Finally, the signature is calculated.   Note that the PKCS#7 contentType “data” is used for both  text and data content types specified in the beginning of this chapter.   Note also that since the input to the message digesting process is the content value (and not for example \"ContentInfo\" as defined in Section 6), the information about the character set associated with the content is not protected. Implementations should therefore take steps to ensure that it is not possible for an attacker to harmfully manipulate this character set information.  For verification, the above structure needs to be constructed based on values transmitted in  SignedContent: content_type,  gmt_utc_time.   Note that the authenticated attributes are included in the in ascending order compared as octet strings.  A proxy server MAY construct a PKCS#7 [PKCS7] SignedData object based on a received SignedContent object. The motivation of doing this would be that some internet or other service applications may require a PKCS#7 formatted object to verify the signature. The conversion to PKCS#7 is based on the original text, the signature and a certificate.   A proxy server MAY also convert a PKCS#7 SignedData object to a SignedContent object for transmission to a mobile device.  When the mobile device receives (e.g. over WSP) a SignedContent object (containing text or any type of data), it should verify the signature and be able to present information on the signer and the result    (c) 2001 Wireless Application Protocol Forum, Ltd All rights reserved. Page 19(27) of verification: if it was succesful, or if it failed with different reasons, like invalid signature or inability to verify the signer's certificate. When the SignedContent object contains signed text, the original text and result of verification must be presented in a manner which is distinctive from texts generated by applications using e.g. WML or WMLScript.   When using an 8-byte signerNonce instead of signingTime (as described above), the following buffer is used as a template:  31 59     30 18        06 09 2A 86 48 86 F7 0D 01 09 03   -- contentType       31 0B           06 09 2A 86 48 86 F7 0D 01 07 01  -- data    30 18  06 0A 2A 86 48 86 F7 0D 01 09 19 03  -- signerNonce 31 0A     04 08 XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX  -- randomNonce    30 23  06 09 2A 86 48 86 F7 0D 01 09 04   -- messageDigest 31 16     04 14 XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX    -- SHA-1 digest  In order to construct the input for hash calculation, the following steps are performed • use initially a 91-byte buffer as above (bytes 1...91) • replace bytes 47...54 with the value of the 8 byte nonce. • replace bytes 72...91 with the 20-byte value of the SHA-1 hash  The next step is to calculate the hash from the above 91-byte buffer. Finally, the signature is calculated.     (c) 2001 Wireless Application Protocol Forum, Ltd All rights reserved. Page 20(27)    (c) 2001 Wireless Application Protocol Forum, Ltd All rights reserved.

Page 23(27) Appendix B  Signature Calculation  B.1 ECDSA Signature Calculation  ECDSA signature calculation for signText is based on ANSI X9.62 [X9.62].  Three aspects of the ECDSA signature process are described: • the input to the signature process; • the signature process itself; and • the output from the signature process.  The input to the ECDSA signature process is one of the completed templates specified in Section 6.2.  Note that ANSI X9.62 regards hashing as an integral part of the signing process – thus the completed template will be hashed using SHA-1 as required during the signing process.  The ECDSA signature process is then performed on the completed template as specified in Section 5.3 of ANSI X9.62.  The output of the ECDSA signature process is a pair of integers r and s. Here the ECDSA signature is converted to a byte string for inclusion in the “Signature” field of “SignedContent” as specified in Section 6 as follows: Convert the integer r to an octet string R and the integer s to an octet string S using the conversion routine specified in Section 4.3.1 of ANSI X9.62 [X9.62]. Both R and S should be the same length as the length needed to represent the order of the base point G. The signature is represented as the concatenation of R and S: R | S.  Note that the signature will subsequently be re-encoded using the ASN.1 syntax for an ECDSA signature specified in Section of ANSI X9.62 if the “SignedContent” format specified in Section 6 is converted to PKCS7 CMS format.  Recommended curves for use with ECDSA are described in Appendix A of WTLS [WAPWTLS].    (c) 2001 Wireless Application Protocol Forum, Ltd All rights reserved. Page 24(27) B.2 RSA PKCS#1 Signature Calculation  The calculation is based on [PKCS1], chapter 10.1. It consists of three steps: message digesting (hashing), data encoding and RSA encryption. (The fourth step, octet-string-to-bit-string conversion is not necessary here.)  The message (the text being signed) is digested using SHA-1 [SHA1]. The 20-byte output and a SHA-1 algorithm identifier shall be combined into an ASN.1 [ASN1] value of type DigestInfo, described below, which shall be DER-encoded [DER] to give an octet string, the data.  DigestInfo ::= SEQUENCE {    digestAlgorithm DigestAlgorithmIdentifier,    digest Digest }  DigestAlgorithmIdentifier ::= AlgorithmIdentifier  Digest ::= OCTET STRING  digestAlgorithm identifies the message-digest algorithm. For this application, it should associate the SHA-1 algorithm. The object identifier is the following  sha-1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=  { iso(1) identified-organization(3)  oiw(14) secsig(3) 2 26 }  The BER encoding of the above is:  2b 0e 03 02 1a  digest is the result of the message digesting process, ie, the message digest.  The BER encoding of DigestInfo is  30 21           -- SEQUENCE (DigestInfo)  30 09          -- SEQUENCE (AlgorithmIdentifier)          06 05 2b 0e 03 02 1a   -- digestAlgorithm = sha-1   05 00         -- parameters = NULL  04 14          -- OCTET STRING (digest)   xx xx xx xx       -- digest value xx xx xx xx  xx xx xx xx  xx xx xx xx  xx xx xx xx   where the last 20 bytes is the message digest. So, in order to implement the BER-encoded DigestInfo, it is sufficient to concatenate the constant 15 bytes and the 20 bytes of the hash.   The resulting data (BER-encoded DigestInfo), is encrypted with the signer’s private key as described in [PKCS1] section 7, using the block type 1. The resulting octet string, is the signature.      (c) 2001 Wireless Application Protocol Forum, Ltd All rights reserved. Page 25(27) Appendix C  UTC Time The universal time type, UTCTime, is a standard ASN.1 type intended for international applications where local time alone is not adequate.  UTCTime specifies the year through the two low order digits and time is specified to the precision of one minute or one second.  UTCTime includes either Z (for Zulu, or Greenwich Mean Time) or a time differential.  For the purposes of this profile, UTCTime values MUST be expressed Greenwich Mean Time (Zulu) and MUST include seconds (i.e., times are YYMMDDHHMMSSZ), even where the number of seconds is zero.  Conforming systems MUST interpret the year field (YY) as follows:  Where YY is greater than or equal to 50, the year shall be interpreted as 19YY; and where YY is less than 50, the year shall be interpreted as 20YY.  The above usage is as is specified in [RFC2459].  For transmission in the signed content AuthenticatedAttribute type (gmt_utc_time) the trailing ‘Z’ is omitted as it is implicit.

The scope for the WAP Forum is to define a  set  of  specifications  to  be  used  by  service  applications.  The  wireless  market  is  growing  very  quickly,  reaching  new  customers  and  providing  new  services.  To  enable  operators  and  manufacturers  to  meet  the  challenges  in  advanced  services,  differentiation,  and  fast/flexible  service  creation,  WAP  selects  and  defines  a  set  of  open,  extensible  protocols  and content formats as a basis for interoperable implementations. The objectives of the WAP Forum are: • To bring Internet content and advanced data services to digital cellular phones and other wireless terminals. • To create a global wireless protocol specification that will work across differing wireless network technologies. • To  enable  the  creation  of  content  and  applications  that  scale  across  a  very  wide  range  of  bearer  networks  and  device types. • To embrace and extend existing standards and technology wherever appropriate.

Introduction This section is informative.  The WAP Architecture [WAPArch] cites TLS as a protocol to provide the Secure Connection service.  In order to make interoperability more manageable and to improve over-the-air efficiency, this document specifies a WAP profile for the use of TLS 1.0.  The WAP profile includes cipher suites, certificate formats, signing algorithms, and the use of session resume, as described below. In addition to the direct access, the WAP-NG architecture also includes the use of the proxies between a WAP client and an origin server [WAPArch]. It is necessary to define the method for TLS tunneling to support the end to end security at the transport level. The following diagram illustrates the TLS tunneling in the WAP-NG architecture [WAPArch],  Stack View of TLS Tunneling  The  client  has  a  direct  connection  at  the  transport  layer  to  the  proxy,  and  the  proxy  has  a  direct  connection  at  the  transport layer to the origin server. The proxy relays the data    flow  at  the  transport  layer  between  two  connections  so  that  a  direct  TLS  session  between  the  client  and  the  origin  server  is  established.  The  wireless  profile  of  TCP  (TCP*)  [WAPArch] is used over the air in the above diagram. 5.1 Note on use of various RFC's as normative references Implementers should note that RFC 2459 (PKIX profile of X.509 certificates) is scheduled to be superseded sometime during 2001.  RFC 2246 (TLS 1.0 specification) may be superseded in the same time frame.  However, there are a large number of implementations following these RFC's and the superseding RFC's will preserve backward compatibility with their predecessors.  RFC's 2459 and 2246 can therefore be used for implementation of TLS according to the profile of TLS in this documentWAP-219-TLS-20010411-a  Page 9 (15)  Copyright Wireless Application Protocol Forum,Ltd, 2001All rights reserved 6. TLS Profile TLS 1.0 [RFC2246] is used as the baseline from which this specification profiles. The client and server implementations MUST conform to TLS 1.0. 6.1 Cipher Suites The server MUST support all of  the following cipher suites           TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA     TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA   The client MUST support at least one of the following cipher suites TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA         TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA The client and server may support any other cipher suites. 6.2 Session 6.2.1 Session Resume The client and server MUST support the session resume as defined in TLS. The longer session life (eg, 12 hours) is RECOMMENDED. The guidelines on the session resume as documented in TLS 1.0 should be respected. 6.2.2 Session Identifier This section is informative. To improve over the air efficiency, it is desirable that the server uses session identifiers of length 8 bytes or less. 6.3 Server Authentication The client and server MUST support server authentication. The client MUST support processing of X.509 server certificates as detailed in \"WAP Certificate and CRL Profile\" [WAPCert].  The client implementation should respect the guidelines for server identity as documented in RFC 2818 [RFC2818]. Furthermore, the client should use the guidelines for handling X.509 server certificates as described in \"WAP Certificate and CRL Profiles Specification\" [WAPCert]. The client should follow the guidelines in [WAPCert] for handling of unknown attributes and extensions if the server certificate does not conform to [WAPCert]. The server SHOULD use the WAP profiled  X.509 server certificate [WAPCert], and MAY use the X.509 server certificate [RFC2459]. 6.4 Client Authentication The server is RECOMMENDED to support client authentication. If client authentication is supported, the server MUST support  the  client  certificates  in  the  form  of  the  WAP  profiled  X.509  client  certificate  [WAPCert]  and  the  X.509  client  certificate  [RFC2459].  The  server  MUST  also  include  the  RSA  certificate  type  (ie,  rsa_sign)  in  the  certificate request [RFC2246] for client certificates, and support verification of the RSA client certificate and signature.  The client MAY support client authentication. If the client authentication is supported, the client MUST support use of the WAP profiled  X.509 client certificate and SHOULD support use of the X.509 certificate [RFC2459].  The client MUST support RSA client certificate and signature. CA should issue the WAP profiled X.509 client certificates [WAPCert].

To improve over-the-air efficiency for the TLS full handshake, the CA should use the minimum possible chain depth for the client and server certificates.  WAP-219-TLS-20010411-a  Page 11 (15)  Copyright Wireless Application Protocol Forum,Ltd, 2001All rights reserved 7. TLS Tunneling As exemplified in the WAP-NG architecture [WAPArch], a HTTP proxy may be used between a client and an origin server. In order to maintain the end to end security at the transport layer while using a proxy, TLS tunneling must be used between the client and the origin server. The proxy functions as a transport level data relay element and is isolated from the TLS session between the client and the origin server. The client MUST support the TLS tunneling if it supports the HTTP proxy. To establish a TLS tunnel, the client MUST use HTTP CONNECT method as defined in RFC 2817 [RFC2817]. Furthermore, the client MUST only establish the tunnel over a raw TCP connection, not an \"upgraded\" connection per RFC 2817 [RFC2817].  The HTTP proxy server should support the HTTP CONNECT method in the manner as defined in RFC 2817 [RFC2817]. It should be noted that a chain of HTTP proxy servers, including proxy servers that do not support HTTP CONNECT method, may be involved for a desired TLS tunnel, the client should not assume that a TLS tunnel can always be successfully established. The client MUST abort the attempt to establish a TLS tunnel if a non-successful response for an HTTP CONNECT request is received.
