It will provide informative best practice recommendations for the CSP 1.3 protocol, ensuring consistent and compatible end-user experience for an IM user while communicating on a device from one manufacturer with end-users on devices from other manufacturers, or when an end-user uses multiple clients from various manufacturers. The Implementation Guidelines are written with a focus on applications written on top of CSP 1.3. Considerations for end-user experience when upgrading from older 1.1/1.2.1 clients to 1.3 clients(s) are also discussed. Considerations for SSP 1.3 are out of scope for this document."}]}}
