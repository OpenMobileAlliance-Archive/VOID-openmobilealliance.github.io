The variety of web browsers and the variations in their supported browsing capabilities results in complex and effort-intensive work for both Content Developers and Service Providers in creating and maintaining web applications that are interoperable across the wide range of devices in order to achieve consistent end-user experience. This document therefore defines requirements that will lead to the resolution of specific areas of mobile web browser functionality that currently results in mobile web browser and web application interoperability issues. It is expected that the resolution to the identified interoperability issues and derived requirements will be in the form: •Change Requests against specifications forming existing OMA Browser enabler releases; •Change Requests against existing OMA Enabler Test Requirements; •Change Requests against existing OMA Enabler Test Specifications; •New OMA conformance specifications, if required. The delivery of a new OMA Enabler release is not expected as part of this activity."}]}}
