The Open Mobile Alliance DS v1.1.2 specifications are based on the SyncML Initiative’s v1.1.1 Data Synchronization specifications and make use of the OMA SyncML Common v1.1.2 specifications as specified in the OMA SyncML Common specifications Enabler Release Definition [ELREDSC]. The SyncML Initiative, Ltd. was a not-for-profit corporation formed by a group of companies who co-operated to produce an open specification for data synchronization and device management. Prior to SyncML, data synchronization and device management had been based on a set of different, proprietary protocols, each functioning only with a very limited number of devices, systems and data types. These non-interoperable technologies have complicated the tasks of users, manufacturers, service providers, and developers. Further, a proliferation of different, proprietary data synchronization and device management protocols has placed barriers to the extended use of mobile devices, has restricted data access and delivery and limited the mobility of the users. SyncML is a specification that contains the following main components: • An XML-based representation protocol • A synchronization protocol and a device management protocol • Transport bindings for the protocol The data representation specifies an XML DTD that allows the representation of all the information required to perform synchronization or device management, including data, metadata and commands. The synchronization and device management protocols specify how SyncML messages conforming to the DTD are exchanged in order to allow a SyncML client and server to exchange additions, deletes, updates and other status information.  There are also DTDs that define the representation of information about the device such as memory capacity, and the representation of various types of Meta information such as security credentials. Although the SyncML specification defines transport bindings that specify how to use a particular transport to exchange messages and responses, the SyncML representation, synchronization and device management protocols are transport-independent. Each SyncML package is completely self-contained, and could in principle be carried by any transport. The initial bindings specified are HTTP, WSP and OBEX, but there is no reason why SyncML could not be implemented using email or message queues, to list only two alternatives. Because SyncML messages are self-contained, multiple transports may be used without either the server or client devices having to be aware of the network topology. Thus, a short-range OBEX connection could be used for local connectivity, with the messages being passed on via HTTP to an Internet-hosted synchronization server. To reduce the data size, a binary coding of SyncML based on the WAP Forum's WBXML is defined. Messages may also be passed in clear text if required. In this and other ways SyncML addresses the bandwidth and resource limitations imposed by mobile devices. SyncML is both data type and data store independent. SyncML can carry any data type that can be represented as a MIME object. To promote interoperability between different implementations of SyncML, the specification includes the representation formats used for common PIM data.   The OMA SyncML Data Synchronization v1.1.2 Enabler Release continues the effort to promote a single, common data synchronization protocol.      2003 Open Mobile Alliance Ltd.  All Rights Reserved.
