The OSPE addresses the need for a standardized environment/infrastructure for developing and deploying services, and addresses the need to quickly and efficiently identify and diagnose faults associated with services that are offered by a Service Provider. Lower service life cycle costs can be achieved by reducing administration (service and subscription provisioning, O&M, etc.) and integration costs of the components used to construct services.  In addition, service manageability can be improved by defining service level diagnostics to enhance the Service Provider's ability to determine whether their complex services are working correctly and if a fault arises in any part of the service chain, that this fault is easily and efficiently traceable and rectifiable. The key objective for the OSPE is to fulfill the following design principles: •Allow component interchangeability;  •Allow the multi-vendor mixing-and-matching of components by defining their interfaces and having consistent semantics of shared data/schema across these components. To achieve such replaceability/reusability of components, we must provide mechanisms to support the full life cycle of components. This can be achieved by specifying standard component interfaces to handle aspects such as installation, configuration, administration, versioning, etc. OSPE will focus standardization efforts in the following areas: •Service Level Diagnostic capabilities including interfaces between components and other Service Provider environments; •Capabilities and interfaces to achieve life-cycle management, including plug & play, of components, applications and services. Section 5 of this document contains use cases describing the issues related with enabler development, deployment, integration, administration, maintenance, etc. Section 6 contains requirements extracted from the use cases presented in section 5."}]}}
