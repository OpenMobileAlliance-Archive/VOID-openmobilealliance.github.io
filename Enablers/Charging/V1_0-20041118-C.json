This document captures the overall charging needs on mobile service enablers, from the perspective of service subscriber, user, mobile network operator, service provider, application provider and content provider. The information contained in this RD is applicable to service providers (i.e. network operators), application/content developers and infrastructure/terminal manufacturers. The Use Cases in this document illustrate the market need for the various charging principles that requires support from mobile service enablers’s interworking charging capabilities. In scope: • Charging functionality requirements across the various service enablers, capturing device, clients, service platforms, connectivity and content. • Requirements to facilitate event / time / session / subscription charging for each service type (communications, content and applications). • Requirements to support online and offline charging methods (i.e. prepay and postpay payment methods), real-time charging and mechanisms for ‘A’ party pays. • Requirements for charging interfaces between content provider, service provider and mobile operator. • Requirements for the management of charging events, which are closely related to identification, authorisation and security mechanisms.
