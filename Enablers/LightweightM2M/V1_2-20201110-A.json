ExamplesThis document, the LwM2M CORE technical specification, describes the LwM2M messaging layer. The LwM2MTRANSPORT specification [LwM2M-TRANSPORT], a companion specification, details the mapping of the messaginglayer to selected transports. The separation between transport and messaging layer improves readability and simplifiesextending LwM2M to further transports. The LwM2M messaging layer uses a RESTful design with several interfaces anda simple data model.1.1. LwM2M version 1.21.1. LwM2M version 1.2This specification defines version 1.2 of the LwM2M protocol and augments [LwM2M-TS_1.1]. Version 1.2 is backwardscompatible to LwM2M version v1.0 and v1.1 with respect to mandatory features.LwM2M v1.2 adds the following new features:New transports for LwM2M; this allows LwM2M messaging to be conveyed over MQTT and over HTTP.Optimizations for the bootstrapping interface; this reduces the amount of data and the number of messagestransmitted during the bootstrapping exchange.Optimizations for the registration interface; this reduces the amount of data transmitted during registrationexchanges.Optimizations for the information reporting interface; observation attributes may now be included in an Observeoperation.Support for LwM2M gateway functionality; this allows non-LwM2M IoT devices as well as LwM2M devices behind agateway to be connected to the LwM2M ecosystem and to manage those devices remotely.New, highly optimized encoding format based on CBOR called LwM2M CBOR.Enhanced functionality for firmware updates.Definition of new notification attributes (edge, confirmable notification, and maximum historical queue). Edgeallows notifications to be triggered on rising and falling edges. Confirmable notifications allow the control ofreliable transmissions of notifications. Maximum historical queue allows the control of time-series data usage.Clarifications of object versioning rules.Updates to use the latest communication security protocols based on TLS and DTLS 1.3 (as well as the use of theConnection ID).Flexibility to control the use of TLS and DTLS 1.3 through configuration information.Untangling the relationship of security credentials and their server configuration.There also numerous clarifications and editorial improvements as well as additional examples based on feedbacksreceived from the LwM2M development community.Details about the transport bindings can be found in [LwM2M-TRANSPORT].1.2. LwM2M version 1.11.2. LwM2M version 1.1LwM2M v1.1 added the following features to v1.0:Enhancement of the LwM2M bootstrapping capabilities allowing for incremental upgrades.Improved support for Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) deployments.Introduction of enhanced registration sequence mechanisms by the LwM2M Client to LwM2M Server(s).Support for LwM2M over TCP/TLS to better support firewall and NAT traversal.Support for application layer security for LwM2M based on OSCORE.Better support of LwM2M over Low Power WANs, including 3GPP CIoT & LoRaWAN.Extended LwM2M operations to enable Resource Instance level access.Performance improvement for retrieving and updating Resources of multiple objects."},{"url":"http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/LightweightM2M/V1_2-20201110-A/OMA-TS-LightweightM2M_Transport-V1_2-20201110-A.pdf","file":"OMA-TS-LightweightM2M_Transport-V1_2-20201110-A.pdf","status":"Approved","version":"V1.2","date":"2020-11-10","contentMediaType":"application/pdf","description":"2.

Credential TypesThis document specifies the transport bindings of the Lightweight Machine-to-Machine (LwM2M) protocol version 1.2.The split between the LwM2M core [LwM2M-CORE] and the transport binding specification improves readability, allowsa cleaner separation between the LwM2M messaging layer and the underlying protocols for conveying these messages,and ultimately better extensibility.LwM2M version 1.0 supported the CoAP over UDP and CoAP over SMS transport bindings. The UDP and SMS transportscan be used with or without DTLS.LwM2M version 1.1 added support for CoAP over TCP and CoAP over Non-IP transport bindings. The TCP transport canbe used with or without TLS. The Non-IP transport is applicable to 3GPP CIoT and LoRaWAN. CoAP over TCP, as definedin [CoAP_TCP], offers better firewall traversal, as explained in Section 1 of [CoAP_TCP].This specification, LwM2M version 1.2, added support for HTTP and MQTT transport bindings.This specification also supports the application layer security protocol OSCORE [OSCORE] which enables support forproxy operations and end-to-end security independently of transport layer protocol."}]}}
