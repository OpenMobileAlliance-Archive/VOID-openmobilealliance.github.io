Bootstrap and LwM2M Server Registration Mechanisms6.2.1.2. Behaviour with Current Transport Binding and Modes6.2.2. Update OperationThis document, the LwM2M CORE technical specification, describes the LwM2M messaging layer. The LwM2MTRANSPORT specification [LwM2M-TRANSPORT], a companion specification, details the mapping of the messaginglayer to selected transports. The separation between transport and messaging layer improves readability and simplifyextending LwM2M to further transports in the future. The LwM2M messaging layer uses a RESTful design with severalinterfaces and a simple data model.1.1. LwM2M version 1.11.1. LwM2M version 1.1This specification defines version 1.1 of the LwM2M protocol with the following new features:Enhancement of the LwM2M bootstrapping capabilities allowing for incremental upgrades.Improved support for Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) deployments.Introduction of enhanced registration sequence mechanisms by the LwM2M Client to LwM2M Server(s).Support for LwM2M over TCP/TLS to better support firewall and NAT traversal.Support for application layer security for LwM2M based on OSCOREBetter support of LwM2M over Low Power WANs, including 3GPP CIoT & LoRaWAN.Extended LwM2M operations to enable Resource Instance level access.Performance improvement for retrieving and updating Resources of multiple objects.Support for JSON using SenML with CBOR serialization for compressed payload with highly efficient transmission.Addition of new data types.For additional transport & security enhancements in LwM2M v1.1 please refer to [LwM2M-TRANSPORT].1.2. LwM2M version 1.01.2. LwM2M version 1.0This document augments LwM2M version 1.0. Version 1.1 is backwards compatible to v1.0 with respect to mandatoryfeatures. LwM2M v1.0 offers the following features:Simple resource model with the core set of objects and resources defined in this specification. The full list ofregistered objects can be found at OMNA.Operations for creation, update, deletion, and retrieval of resources.Asynchronous notifications of resource changes.Support for several serialization formats, namely TLV, JSON, Plain Text and binary data formats and the core set ofLightweightM2M Objects.UDP and SMS transport support.Communication security based on the DTLS protocol supporting different types of credentials."},{"url":"http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/LightweightM2M/V1_1_1-20190617-A/OMA-TS-LightweightM2M_Transport-V1_1_1-20190617-A.pdf","file":"OMA-TS-LightweightM2M_Transport-V1_1_1-20190617-A.pdf","status":"Approved","version":"V1.1.1","date":"2019-06-17","contentMediaType":"application/pdf","description":"2.

OSCORE Related ResourcesThis document specifies the transport bindings of the Lightweight Machine-to-Machine (LwM2M) protocol version 1.1.The split between the LwM2M core [LwM2M-CORE] and the transport binding specification improves readability, allowsa cleaner separation between the LwM2M messaging layer and the underlying protocols for conveying these messages,and ultimately better extensibility.LwM2M version 1.0 supported multiple transport bindings, namely CoAP over UDP, and over SMS. The UDP and SMStransports can be used with or without DTLS. This specification, LwM2M version 1.1, adds support for CoAP over TCP /TLS, and CoAP over Non-IP, namely 3GPP CIoT and LoRaWAN. CoAP over TCP / TLS, as defined in [CoAP_TCP], offersbetter firewall traversal, as explained in Section 1 of [CoAP_TCP].This specification also supports the application layer security protocol OSCORE [OSCORE] which enables support forproxy operations and end-to-end security independently of transport layer protocol."}]}}
