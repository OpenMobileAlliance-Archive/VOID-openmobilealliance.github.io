The scope for Open Mobile Alliance is to define a set of specifications to be used by service applications. The wireless market is growing very quickly, and reaching new customers and services. To enable operators and manufacturers to meet the challenges in advanced services, differentiation and fast/flexible service creation WAP Forum defines a set of protocols in transport, security, transaction, session and application layers. For additional information on the WAP architecture, please refer to “Wireless Application Protocol Architecture Specification” [WAPARCH]. Provisioning is the process by which a WAP client is initially configured with connectivity and application access parameters.  The provisioning process also includes subsequent updates of persistent information in WAP client devices as well as retrieval of management information stored on WAP client devices. The term covers both OTA provisioning and provisioning by means of, e.g., SIM cards.

Provisioning is the process by which a WAP client is configured with a minimum of user interaction. The term covers both OTA provisioning and provisioning by means of, e.g., SIM cards. A WAP client may, for example, be provisioned with connectivity and application information by pushing configuration parameters over the air from a server to a WAP client. This specification defines the content encoding by what configuration parameters are presented to the WAP client in the provisioning framework. The content encoding is defined in terms of binary XML [WBXML] and is interpreted and handled at the application level of the WAP architecture. However, the handling and use of provisioned information is outside the scope of this specification.
