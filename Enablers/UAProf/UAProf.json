The user agent profile contains information used for content formatting purposes.  A user agent profile is distinct from a user preference profile that would contain application-specific information about the user for content selection purposes.  For example, a user preference profile might designate whether the user is interested in receiving sports scores and, if so, the particular teams.  The specification of user preference profiles is beyond the scope of this document. In accordance with Composite Capability/Preference Profiles (CC/PP) [CCPP], the user agent profile schema is defined using an RDF schema and vocabulary [RDF-Schema].  This document defines the structure of this schema in terms of the class definitions and semantics of attributes for devices adhering to the WAP standard.  Extensibility guidelines are also offered to assist in extending the schema with new components. Regarding the user agent profile, this document assumes that: • The information contained within the profile is provided on behalf of the user who will be receiving the content contained in the associated WSP or HTTP response. Profiles may also be used by the Push Proxy Gateway (PPG). • The CC/PP repository storing the profile is secure, meaning that it does not permit unauthorized modification to stored profile information. The functionality associated with this repository may be implemented in a WAP gateway or intermediate proxy or as a separate standalone element in the network.  • WSP/HTTP headers are generally not encrypted.  Because this specification does not define any security mechanisms, care must be taken when including user-confidential information1 in the profile unless the profile is transmitted over an end-to-end secure channel (e.g. TLS/WTLS to the origin server). • An implicit chain of trust exists between the client and origin server. The integrity of the profile is maintained (in other words, not compromised) as it is transmitted through or cached within the network. It is assumed that the network elements that contribute property descriptions to the profile are trusted.  Network elements will not assemble a “history” about users by tracking the deltas in their profile over time.  • To ensure the integrity of the profile, lower-level mechanisms, such as TLS or WTLS, must be used. Use of the profile by the origin server is intended to optomize the content to the characteristics of the device, and the users’ preferences. If the profile were discarded, corrupted, or otherwise inaccessible, the origin server should still provide content to the client. It should be noted that user agent profiles are not statements of conformance but rather, a content negotiation tool to be used to adapt content between a client and content provider.                                                                  1 The definition of “confidential” varies among different users, cultures, and service providers.  It is therefore impossible to define a profile schema that meets the security needs of all users while still conveying any useful information."},{"url":"http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/UAProf/OMA-UAProf-V2_0-20030520-C1.zip","file":"OMA-UAProf-V2_0-20030520-C1.zip","status":"","version":"","date":"","contentMediaType":"application/zip"},{"url":"http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/UAProf/OMA-WAP-UAProf-V1_1-20021212-C.pdf","file":"OMA-WAP-UAProf-V1_1-20021212-C.pdf","status":"Candidate","version":"V1.1","date":"2002-12-12","contentMediaType":"application/pdf","description":"The User Agent Profile specification is concerned with capturing classes of device capabilities and preference information.
