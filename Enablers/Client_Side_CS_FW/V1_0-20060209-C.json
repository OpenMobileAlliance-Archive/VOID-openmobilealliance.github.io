The architecture described in this document is restricted to client/terminal deployments only.  Other possible deployments of this architecture (e.g. proxy, server, etc.) are not within the scope of this architecture.  Formal definition of malicious content is not in the scope of this architecture and thus is left to each implementation.  The architecture described in this document includes a Scan Engine functional component.  It is recognized that such a component is likely to have an associated database of profiles to encapsulate information such as its processing rules.  However, such a database and its profiles are not in the scope of this architecture.  This architecture is based on the requirements listed in [CSCSF-RD-v1]."},{"url":"http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/Client_Side_CS_FW/V1_0-20060209-C/OMA-ERELD-Client_Side_CS_FW-V1_0-20060209-C.pdf","file":"OMA-ERELD-Client_Side_CS_FW-V1_0-20060209-C.pdf","status":"Candidate","version":"V1.0","date":"2006-02-09","contentMediaType":"application/pdf","description":"The scope of this document is limited to the Enabler Release Definition of Client Side Content Screening Framework according to OMA Release process and the Enabler Release specification baseline listed in section 5.
