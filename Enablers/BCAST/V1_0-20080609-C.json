The requirements contained in chapter 6 of this document address the whole end-to-end framework for Mobile Broadcast, and are structured along the following functions of the Mobile Broadcast Services Enabler: service discovery, service guide, provisioning, content and service protection, real-time streaming distribution, file distribution, and charging.
