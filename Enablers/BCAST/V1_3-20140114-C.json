This is referred to as \"generic adaptation\", which can be applied for any kind of BDS. This is the adaptation type presented in this document. The underlying BDS may already have a method for a function defined in the BCAST 1.3 Enabler. In that case BDS adaptation specification defines the cases where this method selected in the underlying BDS is utilised for the BCAST function also, meaning that BCAST functionality is adapted. This is referred to as \"BDS specific adaptation\".  BDS specific adaptation is not part of this document.

Introduction  (Informative)  This technical specification specifies how the OMA Mobile Broadcast Services (BCAST) Enabler can be currently implemented to achieve one mode of adaptation: 1. Generic adaptation over an underlying WiMAX IP transmission network where the radio bearer layer towards the terminal is based on unicast messaging. In this mode, this Technical Specification explains how the BCAST Enabler has access to the IP transport layer so that BCAST services can be provided from BCAST Network entities to BCAST Terminal. Furthermore, this allows a common behaviour across multiple BCAST enabled BCAST Distribution Systems (BDSes)   Note that IP multicast and IP unicast can be used between SS/MS (Subscriber Station / Mobile Station) and CSN (Connectivity Service Network) or ASP (Application Service Provider) reachable via CSN on the network layer even though the data transmission is always unicast between one SS/MS and BS (Base Station) at the radio layer.

Overview of WiMAX (Informative) WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) has been developed by WiMAX Forum as mobile broadband technology. It consists of network and bearer system for delivering the IP traffic and IP-based services to mobile users. On bearer level WiMAX is based upon the IEEE 801.16 standard enabling the delivery of wireless broadband services. The IEEE 802.16 standard was developed to deliver non-line-of-sight (LoS) connectivity between a subscriber station and base station with typical cell radius of three to ten kilometers.    Figure 1: WiMAX Network Reference Model WiMAX Network Reference Model (see Figure 1 above) provides simple, all-IP architecture for the delivery of IP data. WiMAX system per release 1.1.0 provides unicast delivery methods.  The following specifications define WiMAX in the scope of this specification:  [WiMAX-S2] describes the WiMAX architecture and reference points.  [WiMAX-S3] describes the technical details and protocols in WiMAX.  [WiMAX-MP] defines a particular profile of bearer layer and MAC for mobile access Architectural elements [WiMAX-S2]:  Subscriber Station / Mobile Station (SS/MS) is the end user terminal implementing WiMAX access.  Access Service Network (ASN) defines a logical boundary and represents a convenient way to describe aggregation of functional entities and corresponding message flows associated with the access services.  Connectivity Service Network (CSN) provides connectivity service through which ASN connects with another CSN, with Application Service Provider (ASP) Network or with Internet."},{"url":"http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/BCAST/V1_3-20140114-C/OMA-TS-DRM_XBS-V1_3-20140114-C.pdf","file":"OMA-TS-DRM_XBS-V1_3-20140114-C.pdf","status":"Candidate","version":"V1.3","date":"2014-01-14","contentMediaType":"application/pdf","description":"Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) specifications are the result of continuous work to define industry-wide interoperable mechanisms for developing applications and services that are deployed over wireless communication networks.
