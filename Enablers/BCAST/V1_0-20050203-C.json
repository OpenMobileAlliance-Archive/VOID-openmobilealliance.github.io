This document covers requirements on both existing and new enablers. For existing enablers, this may involve enhancements or extensions to make them broadcast capable. The use cases contained in chapter 5 of this document provide examples of Mobile Broadcast Services that should be enabled. The requirements contained in chapter 6 of this document address the whole end-to-end framework for Mobile Broadcast, and are structured along the following functions of the Mobile Broadcast Services Enabler: service discovery, service guide, provisioning, content and service protection, real-time streaming distribution, file distribution, and charging. The enablers must be bearer independent in order to be useful for a diverse and heterogeneous infrastructure. The development of an enabler for Mobile Broadcast Services will consider a broad set of stakeholders from various industries, the varied business links between them, and may take into account any existing infrastructure."}]}}
