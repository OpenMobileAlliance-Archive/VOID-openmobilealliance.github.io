The interfaces and functionalities of NavSe enabler are specified in a separate document according to RESTful network API approach. The NavSe enabler provides an overall framework (mechanisms, functionalities, APIs, and etc.) to enable delivering route information for navigation services. The following areas will be covered as part of the scope of the enabler.  Delivering route information to the navigation application  Delivering traffic information for driving to the navigation application  Providing functionalities for public safety usages  Security and privacy aspects NavSe enabler will reuse as much as possible existing technologies. In particular, with respect to an interface specification, these are in the scope of this enabler:  To reuse traffic information data formats defined by TPEG in [ISO TTI]"},{"url":"http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/NavSe/V1_0-20200213-A/OMA-ERELD-NavSe-V1_0-20200213-A.pdf","file":"OMA-ERELD-NavSe-V1_0-20200213-A.pdf","status":"Approved","version":"V1.0","date":"2020-02-13","contentMediaType":"application/pdf","description":"The scope of this document is limited to the Enabler Release Definition of NavSe Enabler v1.0 according to OMA Release process and the Enabler Release specification baseline listed in section 5."},{"url":"http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/NavSe/V1_0-20200213-A/OMA-ERP-NavSe-V1_0-20200213-A.zip","file":"OMA-ERP-NavSe-V1_0-20200213-A.zip","status":"Approved","version":"V1.0","date":"2020-02-13","contentMediaType":"application/zip"},{"url":"http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/NavSe/V1_0-20200213-A/OMA-SUP-XSD_rest_NavSe-V1_0-20200213-A.txt","file":"OMA-SUP-XSD_rest_NavSe-V1_0-20200213-A.txt","status":"Approved","version":"V1.0","date":"2020-02-13","contentMediaType":"text/plain"},{"url":"http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/NavSe/V1_0-20200213-A/OMA-TS-REST_NetAPI_NavSe-V1_0-20200213-A.pdf","file":"OMA-TS-REST_NetAPI_NavSe-V1_0-20200213-A.pdf","status":"Approved","version":"V1.0","date":"2020-02-13","contentMediaType":"application/pdf","description":"This specification defines a RESTful API for Navigation Service Framework using HTTP protocol bindings, based on application requirements and architecture defined in [NavSe_ER].
