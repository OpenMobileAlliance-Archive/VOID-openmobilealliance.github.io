This architecture is based on the requirements listed in the MobAd Requirement Document [OMA-MOBAD-RD]. The objective of the MobAd Enabler architecture is to define network-side and device-side MobAd Enabler components, the interface(s) between them and the interface(s) exposed by those components to some entities that rely on MobAd Enabler (i.e. device-side Ad Apps as well as network-side SP Apps). The needs of external entities such as Content Providers, Advertisers, etc are not considered when defining interfaces for MobAd Enabler components, because those external entities are out of scope of MobAd AD and TS. The MobAd Enabler architecture is designed to support the core functionalities related to mobile advertising, in particular Ad Selection, Ad Delivery and Ad Metrics data handling."},{"url":"http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/MobAd/V1_0-20100408-C/OMA-ERELD-MobAd-V1_0-20100408-C.pdf","file":"OMA-ERELD-MobAd-V1_0-20100408-C.pdf","status":"Candidate","version":"V1.0","date":"2010-04-08","contentMediaType":"application/pdf","description":"The scope of this document is limited to the Enabler Release Definition of MobAd according to OMA Release process and the Enabler Release specification baseline listed in section 5."},{"url":"http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/MobAd/V1_0-20100408-C/OMA-ERP-MobAd_V1_0-20100408-C.zip","file":"OMA-ERP-MobAd_V1_0-20100408-C.zip","status":"","version":"","date":"","contentMediaType":"application/zip"},{"url":"http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/MobAd/V1_0-20100408-C/OMA-RD-Mobile-Advertising-V1_0-20100126-C.pdf","file":"OMA-RD-Mobile-Advertising-V1_0-20100126-C.pdf","status":"Candidate","version":"V1.0","date":"2010-01-26","contentMediaType":"application/pdf","description":"This Requirement Document (RD) contains use cases and defines the requirements for the Mobile Advertisement Enabler.

Providing broadcast distribution of Advertisements (Ads) and Ad Metadata to BCAST-enabled MobAd terminals, and 2. Assisting the Ad Engine in selective Ad reception and storage, for subsequent delivery to Ad App(s). The scope of this document comprises the following aspects: • Interfaces and metadata required to achieve interoperability between the MobAd Ad Server operating over BCAST at the network side, and the MobAd Ad Engine operating beneath BCAST at the terminal side. • Utilization of the BCAST Service Guide [BCAST11-SG] specification which defines an Ad service, for carrying Ads and Ad Metadata, and its file broadcast schedule.  In the Ad service, the Service Guide also provides network-defined criteria for Ad filtering by the terminal."},{"url":"http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/MobAd/V1_0-20100408-C/OMA-TS-MobAd_Core-V1_0-20100408-C.pdf","file":"OMA-TS-MobAd_Core-V1_0-20100408-C.pdf","status":"Candidate","version":"V1.0","date":"2010-04-08","contentMediaType":"application/pdf","description":"This document aims at specifying the functions and interfaces of MobAd Ad Server and MobAd Ad Engine as well as describing expected behaviors from Ad Engine, Ad Server, Ad App and SP App. These functions and behaviors relate to: • Ad Selection functions (e.g. based on criteria such as rules, metadata, C&P data) • Delivery of selected Ad(s) • Support for interactivity capabilities  • Reporting, measurement and validation of user actions with ads.
