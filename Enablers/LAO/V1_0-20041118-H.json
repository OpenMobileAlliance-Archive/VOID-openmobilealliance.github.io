The architecture is expected to identify missing functions, interfaces, etc that are necessary to support future OMA location enablers. Thus, the scope of the OMA Mobile Location Services overview architecture spans across all the location-related architectures that are specified in OMA, i.e., subsequent architectures defined in OMA exist within the scope defined by the overall MLS architecture. This Requirements Document (RD) containing use cases and normative enumerated requirements establishes high level requirements for the OMA Mobile Location Services architecture."}]}}
