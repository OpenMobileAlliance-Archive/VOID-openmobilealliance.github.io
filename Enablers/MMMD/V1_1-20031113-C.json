Such  services  enable  access  to  mobile  services  through  different  modalities  (e.g.  keypad,  GUI,  Voice,  handwriting)  or  devices. The requirements are primarily viewed from an end user point of view. Implications are derived in terms of requirements on network operators, service providers and terminals manufacturers. The  requirements  apply  only  to  supporting  the  applications  or  services  for  which  multimodal  or  multi-device  interactions make sense and are desired.  Applications and services may otherwise be designed without providing such a user experience."}]}}
