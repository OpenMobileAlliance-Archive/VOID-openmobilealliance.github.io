It  would  allow  a  Device Management  Server  to  easily  retrieve  the  list  of  the  supported  MOs  and  specific  details.    Management  Authorities  can  use this information for various management operations, for example provisioning services to capable devices through creating or updating DM Tree based on MO information."},{"url":"http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/ListMO/V1_0-20110511-C/OMA-ERP-ListMO-V1_0-20110511-C.zip","file":"OMA-ERP-ListMO-V1_0-20110511-C.zip","status":"Candidate","version":"V1.0","date":"2011-05-11","contentMediaType":"application/zip"},{"url":"http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/ListMO/V1_0-20110511-C/OMA-SUP-MO_ListMO-V1_0-20110511-C.txt","file":"OMA-SUP-MO_ListMO-V1_0-20110511-C.txt","status":"Candidate","version":"V1.0","date":"2011-05-11","contentMediaType":"text/plain"}]}}
