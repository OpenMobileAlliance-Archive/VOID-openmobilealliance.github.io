The purpose of the SUPL Configuration Services 1.0 reference release is to provide a mobile operator the ability to host a SUPL configuration and provisioning service that SUPL devices may query to obtain SUPL configuration information. The configuration information may include but not be limited to:  An H-SLP for a mobile operator.  Multiple E-SLPs for a mobile operator.  Multiple D-SLPs for a mobile operator.  An H-SLP to utilize for an individual application. This configuration mechanism is needed to allow the mobile operator the most flexibility when building their mobile LBS platforms.    This document will define the methods for obtaining SUPL configuration data from a mobile operator.  The architecture for transferring the configuration data will be implemented using the OMA Device Management [OMA DM] enabler."},{"url":"http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/SUPLCS/V1_0-20140318-A/OMA-RRELD-SUPLCS-V1_0-20140318-A.pdf","file":"OMA-RRELD-SUPLCS-V1_0-20140318-A.pdf","status":"Approved","version":"V1.0","date":"2014-03-18","contentMediaType":"application/pdf","description":"The scope of this document is limited to the Reference Release Definition of SUPL Configuration Services according to OMA Release process and the Reference Release document baseline listed in section 5."},{"url":"http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/SUPLCS/V1_0-20140318-A/OMA-RRP-SUPLCS-V1_0-20140318-A.zip","file":"OMA-RRP-SUPLCS-V1_0-20140318-A.zip","status":"Approved","version":"V1.0","date":"2014-03-18","contentMediaType":"application/zip"},{"url":"http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/SUPLCS/V1_0-20140318-A/OMA-SUP-MO_SUPLCS-V1_0-20140318-A.txt","file":"OMA-SUP-MO_SUPLCS-V1_0-20140318-A.txt","status":"Approved","version":"V1.0","date":"2014-03-18","contentMediaType":"text/plain"}]}}
