            <p>The Presence SIMPLE enabler is a service that manages the collection and controlled dissemination of presence information.</p>
            <p>The Presence Specification defined a presence service framework as consisting of the following functional entities:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>a Presence Source, which publishes presence information to be available to interested parties (Watchers)</li>
                <li>a Watcher, which subscribes to receive published presence information made available by Presence Sources</li>
                <li>a Watcher Information Subscriber, which subscribes to receive information about Watchers</li>
                <li>a Presence Server, which receives presence information from Presence Sources, makes presence information available to Watchers and watcher information available to Watcher Information Subscribers</li>
                <li>a Resource List Server, that provides Watchers with an efficient method of subscribing for presence information of multiple Presentities</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A Presentity may utilize the Presence XDMS [PRS_XDM] to define apresence authorization policy that affects the Watcher's view of the Presentity's presence information. The Presence Server receives the policy from the Presence XDMS and enforces it upon subscriptions received from Watchers.</p>
            <p>A Watcher may utilize the RLS XDMS [PRS_RLSXDM] to define lists of Presentities, which provide the Watcher with an efficient method to subscribe for presence information.</p>
            <p>OMA Presence SIMPLE V1.0.1 has been made Historic; its documents have been made obsolete. OMA no longer intends to maintain this release.</p>
