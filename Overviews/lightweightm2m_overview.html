        <div>
            <p>LightweightM2M is a fast deployable client-server specification that provides a machine to machine service.</p>
            <p>LightweightM2M is principally a device management protocol that has been designed to be extensible to meet application requirements. LightweightM2M is not restricted to device management, it can be used to transfer service / application data.</p>
            <p>LightweightM2M defines the interface between M2M device and M2M Server. It enables the M2M Service Provider to deploy a M2M system to provide service to the M2M user.</p>
            
            <h2>Release Directories Naming Convention</h2>
            <p>The naming convention for the release directories is:<br>
               Version - Year Month Day - Release Status<br>
               e.g V1_0-20161215-C</p>

            <p>The ETS directory contains interoperability and/or conformance test cases.</p>

            <p>The EVP directory contains documents describing the validation criteria for approving the related enabler. These documents have been discontinued and the relevant sections have been added to the ETS appendix.</p>

            <p>It is recommended that the latest suitable release be selected unless an earlier release is specifically required.</p>

            <h2>Release Status</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Approved (A)</strong><br>When a Candidate Release has undergone a period of public comment and completed any applicable interoperability testing then it is published as an Approved Release.</li>
                <li><strong>Candidate (C)</strong><br>As soon as the documents making up the Release have been approved by OMA, they are published as a Candidate Release.</li>
                <li><strong>Draft (D)</strong><br>Unapproved documents are available as Draft documents.</li>
                <li><strong>Historic (H)</strong><br>The Historic state is used for documents that have been made obsolete and which OMA SpecWorks no longer intends to maintain.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Document File Types</h2>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Architecture Document (AD)</strong><br>The Architecture Document contains an architecture diagram, protocol endpoints description, interfaces definition and detailed descriptions for the OMA LightweightM2M enabler. The architecture diagram shows the client and server components in this enabler as well as the interfaces between these two components. Furthermore, it gives a short description for the functions of these interfaces.</li>
                <li><strong>Enabler Release Definition (ERELD)</strong><br>Lists all the component files in the release.</li>
                <li><strong>Enabler Test Specification (ETS)</strong><br>This document describes in detail the available test cases for LightweightM2M as specified in the Technical Specifications. The test cases are split into two categories, conformance and interoperability test cases. The conformance test cases are aimed to verify the adherence to normative requirements described in the technical specifications. The interoperability test cases are aimed to verify that implementations of the specifications work satisfactory.</li>
                <li><strong>Enabler Validation Plan (EVP)</strong><br>This document details the Validation plan for the LightweightM2M V1.0 Enabler Release. The successful accomplishment of the validation activities will be required for the Enabler to be considered for Approved status. The validation plan is based on testing expectations in the Enabler Test Requirements (ETR). While the specific test activities to be performed are described in the Enabler Test Specification (ETS) the test environment is described in this plan. This test environment details infrastructure, operational and participation requirements identified for the testing activities. These documents have been discontinued and the relevant sections have been added to the ETS appendix.</li>
                <li><strong>Objects (SUP XML)</strong><br>LwM2M Object definitions.</li>
                <li><strong>Requirements Document (RD)</strong><br>The Requirements Document contains use cases and requirements for the OMA LightweightM2M enabler. It describes a set of functional requirements for M2M service enablement between the LwM2M Server and the LwM2M Client and the device management from the LwM2M Server to the LwM2M Clients.</li>
                <li><strong>Technical Specification (TS)</strong><br>The Technical Specification documents specify the Lightweight Machine-to-Machine (LwM2M) protocol that includes a simple resource model, operations for creation, update, deletion, and retrieval of resources, asynchronous notifications of resource changes, support for several serialization formats, UDP and SMS transport support, communication security based on the DTLS and support for use of multiple LwM2M Servers.</li>
                <li><strong>XML Schema (SUP XSD)</strong><br>The LwM2M XML Schema definition for the LwM2M Objects.</li>
            </ul>
