                Welcome to the OMA TestFest Overview pages. The following information should provide you with everything you need to know about applying to attend and
                participating in an OMA TestFest and designed to help you understand what TestFests are about, what they are for and what will happen during the event. 
            </p>
            <p>
                TestFests are held in a confidential and secure testing environment where companies can bring their Client or Server implementation(s) based on an OMA Enabler to test in multiple multi-vendor combinations.
                These events are open to both OMA member and non-member companies.

                            There are 1 to 2 TestFest events held per year. These events are hosted in a variety of locations and venues throughout North America, Europe, and Asia. Registration fees are per implementation (engineers are free to attend) and vary based on the expenses
                            estimated to cover the event. If you are interested in hosting a TestFest at your company’s facility, <a href="http://openmobilealliance.org/contact-us/">please contact the OMA staff</a>

                            During registration, you will be asked to select which OMA Enabler you will be testing and if you are a Client or Server. The specified fee for that event
                            will be due upon registering and the event information will inform you what the fee covers / includes for the event.<br>
                            Once registration closes, OMA staff will create a formal testing agenda that will be distributed to participants on-site. More detailed travel and event information, including recommendations on where to stay, a general overview of the schedule,
                            arriving at the TestFest, and what to expect on-site, will be distributed via email to all participants as registration is in progress and once registration closes.<br>

                            One of the important aspects of any interoperability testing session is to record and process the problems
                            found in the implementations being tested. In order for the relevant working groups to determine how a problem should be resolved, TestFest participants may have the
                            opportunity to raise their queries directly with the corresponding Technical Working Group.

                            For LWM2M Test events, participants are asked to submit any issues they encounter with the specification on the OMA GitHub
                            <a href="https://github.com/OpenMobileAlliance/OMA_LwM2M_for_Developers/issues">Issue Reporting Tool</a>,
                            which is monitored by the Device Management Working Group.

                                    Different web-enabled devices have different input, output, hardware, software, network and browser capabilities. In order for a web server or web-based application
                                    to provide optimized content to different clients it requires a description of the capabilities of the client known as the delivery context. Recently two new compatible standards have been created for
                                    describing delivery context: Composite Capabilities / Preferences Profile (CC/PP) created by the W3C and User Agent Profile (UAProf) created by the WAP Forum.
